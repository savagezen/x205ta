# This file contains some information for
# the passwd (1) command and other tools
# creating or modifying passwords.

# Define default crypt hash.
# CRYPT={des,md5,blowfish,sha256,sha512}
CRYPT=sha512

# Use another crypt hash for group passwords.
# This is used by gpasswd, fallback is the CRYPT entry.
# GROUP_CRYPT=des

# We can override the default for a specific service
# by appending the service name (FILES, YP, NISPLUS, LDAP).
#
# For local files, use a more secure hash. We
# don't need to be portable here:
CRYPT_FILES=sha512
#
# For NIS, we should always use DES:
CRYPT_YP=des

# sometimes we need to specify special options for a hash (variable
# is prepended by the name of the crypt hash). In case of blowfish
# and sha* this is the number of rounds
# blowfish: 4-31
# BLOWFISH_CRYPT_FILES=5
# sha256/sha512: 1000-9999999
# SHA512_CRYPT_FILES=1000
