median

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the median of an array of values

 USAGE
  m = median (a [,i])

 DESCRIPTION
  This function computes the median of an array of values.  The median
  is defined to be the value such that half of the the array values will be
  less than or equal to the median value and the other half greater than or
  equal to the median value.  If the array has an even number of
  values, then the median value will be the smallest value that is
  greater than or equal to half the values in the array.

  If called with a second argument, then the optional argument
  specifies the dimension of the array over which the median is to be
  taken.  In this case, an array of one less dimension than the input
  array will be returned.

 NOTES
  This function makes a copy of the input array and then partially
  sorts the copy.  For large arrays, it may be undesirable to allocate
  a separate copy.  If memory use is to be minimized, the
  `median_nc' function should be used.

median_nc

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the median of an array

 USAGE
  m = median_nc (a [,i])

 DESCRIPTION
  This function computes the median of an array.  Unlike the
  `median' function, it does not make a temporary copy of the
  array and, as such, is more memory efficient at the expense
  increased run-time.  See the `median' function for more
  information.

  median, mean

--------------------------------------------------------------

mean

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the mean of the values in an array

 USAGE
  m = mean (a [,i])

 DESCRIPTION
  This function computes the arithmetic mean of the values in an
  array.  The optional parameter `i' may be used to specify the
  dimension over which the mean it to be take.  The default is to
  compute the mean of all the elements.

 EXAMPLE
  Suppose that `a' is a two-dimensional MxN array.  Then

    m = mean (a);

  will assign the mean of all the elements of `a' to `m'.
  In contrast,

    m0 = mean(a,0);
    m1 = mean(a,1);

  will assign the N element array to `m0', and an array of
  M elements to `m1'.  Here, the jth element of `m0' is
  given by `mean(a[*,j])', and the jth element of `m1' is
  given by `mean(a[j,*])'.

--------------------------------------------------------------

stddev

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the standard deviation of an array of values

 USAGE
  s = stddev (a [,i])

 DESCRIPTION
  This function computes the standard deviation of the values in the
  specified array. The optional parameter `i' may be used to
  specify the dimension over which the standard-deviation it to be
  taken.  The default is to compute the standard deviation of all the
  elements.

 NOTES
  This function returns the unbiased N-1 form of the sample standard
  deviation.

--------------------------------------------------------------

kurtosis

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the kurtosis of an array of values

 USAGE
  s = kurtosis (a)

 DESCRIPTION
 This function computes the so-called kurtosis of the array `a'.

 NOTES
 This function is defined such that the kurtosis of the normal
 distribution is 0, and is also known as the ``excess-kurtosis''.

binomial

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute binomial coefficients

 USAGE
  c = binomial (n [,m])

 DESCRIPTION
  This function computes the binomial coefficients (n m) where (n m)
  is given by n!/(m!(n-m)!).  If `m' is not provided, then an
  array of coefficients for m=0 to n will be returned.

--------------------------------------------------------------

chisqr_cdf

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the Chisqr CDF

 USAGE
  cdf = chisqr_cdf (Int_Type n, Double_Type d)

 DESCRIPTION
 This function returns the probability that a random number
 distributed according to the chi-squared distribution for `n'
 degrees of freedom will be less than the non-negative value `d'.

 NOTES
 The importance of this distribution arises from the fact that if
 `n' independent random variables `X_1,...X_n' are
 distributed according to a gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and
 a variance of 1, then the sum

    X_1^2 + X_2^2 + ... + X_n^2

 follows the chi-squared distribution with `n' degrees of freedom.

poisson_cdf

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the Poisson CDF

 USAGE
  cdf = poisson_cdf (Double_Type m, Int_Type k)

 DESCRIPTION

 distribution parameterized by the value `m'.  For values of
 `m>100' and `abs(m-k)<sqrt(m)', the Wilson and Hilferty
 asymptotic approximation is used.

smirnov_cdf

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the Kolmogorov CDF using Smirnov's asymptotic form

 USAGE
  cdf = smirnov_cdf (x)

 DESCRIPTION

 upon equation 1.4 from W. Feller, "On the Kolmogorov-Smirnov limit
 theorems for empirical distributions", Annals of Math. Stat, Vol 19

kim_jennrich_cdf

 SYNOPSIS
  Compute the 2-sample KS CDF using the Kim-Jennrich Algorithm

 USAGE
  p = kim_jennrich (UInt_Type m, UInt_Type n, UInt_Type c)

  This function returns the exact two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
  probability that that `D_mn <= c/(mn)', where `D_mn' is
  the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic computed from samples of
  sizes `m' and `n'.

  The algorithm used is that of Kim and Jennrich.  The run-time scales
  as m*n.  As such, it is recommended that asymptotic form given by
  the `smirnov_cdf' function be used for large values of m*n.

--------------------------------------------------------------

ks_test

 SYNOPSIS
  One sample Kolmogorov test

 USAGE
  p = ks_test (CDF [,&D])

 DESCRIPTION
 This function applies the Kolmogorov test to the data represented by
 `CDF' and returns the p-value representing the probability that
 the data values are ``consistent'' with the underlying distribution
 function. If the optional parameter is passed to the function, then
 it must be a reference to a variable that, upon return, will be
 set to the value of the Kolmogorov statistic..

 The `CDF' array that is passed to this function must be computed
 from the assumed probability distribution function.  For example, if
 the data are constrained to lie between 0 and 1, and the null
 hypothesis is that they follow a uniform distribution, then the CDF
 will be equal to the data.  In the data are assumed to be normally
 (Gaussian) distributed, then the `normal_cdf' function can be
 used to compute the CDF.

 EXAMPLE
 Suppose that X is an array of values obtained from repeated
 measurements of some quantity.  The values are are assumed to follow
 a normal distribution with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of
 3.  The `ks_test' may be used to test this hypothesis using:

    pval = ks_test (normal_cdf(X, 20, 3));

ks_test2

 SYNOPSIS

 DESCRIPTION
 This function applies the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to two
 datasets `X' and `Y' and returns p-value for the null
 hypothesis that they share the same underlying distribution.
 If the optional parameter is passed to the function, then
 it must be a reference to a variable that, upon return, will be
 set to the value of the statistic.

 NOTES
 If `length(X)*length(Y)<=10000', the `kim_jennrich_cdf'
 function will be used to compute the exact probability.  Otherwise an
 asymptotic form will be used.

kuiper_test

 SYNOPSIS
  Perform a 1-sample Kuiper test

 USAGE
  pval = kuiper_test (CDF [,&D])

 DESCRIPTION
 This function applies the Kuiper test to the data represented by
 `CDF' and returns the p-value representing the probability that
 the data values are ``consistent'' with the underlying distribution
 function.  If the optional parameter is passed to the function, then
 it must be a reference to a variable that, upon return, will be
 set to the value of the Kuiper statistic.

 The `CDF' array that is passed to this function must be computed
 from the assumed probability distribution function.  For example, if
 the data are constrained to lie between 0 and 1, and the null
 hypothesis is that they follow a uniform distribution, then the CDF
 will be equal to the data.  In the data are assumed to be normally
 (Gaussian) distributed, then the `normal_cdf' function can be
 used to compute the CDF.

 EXAMPLE
 Suppose that X is an array of values obtained from repeated
 measurements of some quantity.  The values are are assumed to follow
 a normal distribution with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of
 3.  The `ks_test' may be used to test this hypothesis using:

    pval = kuiper_test (normal_cdf(X, 20, 3));

 DESCRIPTION
 This function applies the 2-sample Kuiper test to two
 datasets `X' and `Y' and returns p-value for the null
 hypothesis that they share the same underlying distribution.
 If the optional parameter is passed to the function, then
 it must be a reference to a variable that, upon return, will be
 set to the value of the Kuiper statistic.

 NOTES
 The p-value is computed from an asymotic formula suggested by
 Stephens, M.A., Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol
 69, No 347, 1974, pp 730-737.

 DESCRIPTION
 This function performs a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and returns the
 p-value for the null hypothesis that there is no difference between
 the distributions represented by the datasets `X' and `Y'.

 If a third argument is given, it must be a reference to a variable
 whose value upon return will be to to the rank-sum of `X'.

 QUALIFIERS
 The function makes use of the following qualifiers:

     side=">"  :    H0: P(X<Y) >= 1/2    (right-tail)
     side="<"  :    H0: P(X<Y) <= 1/2    (left-tail)

 The default null hypothesis is that `P(X<Y)=1/2'.

 NOTES
 There are a number of definitions of this test.  While the exact
 definition of the statistic varies, the p-values are the same.

 If `length(X)<50', `length(Y)' < 50, and ties are not
 present, then the exact p-value is computed using the
 `mann_whitney_cdf' function.  Otherwise a normal distribution is
 used.

 This test is often referred to as the non-parametric generalization
 of the Student t-test.
