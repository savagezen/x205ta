Chapter 1. Introduction

Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) is a suite of shared
libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose how applications
authenticate users.

In other words, without (rewriting and) recompiling a PAM-aware application, it
is possible to switch between the authentication mechanism(s) it uses. Indeed,
one may entirely upgrade the local authentication system without touching the
applications themselves.

Historically an application that has required a given user to be authenticated,
has had to be compiled to use a specific authentication mechanism. For example,
in the case of traditional UN*X systems, the identity of the user is verified
by the user entering a correct password. This password, after being prefixed by
a two character ``salt'', is encrypted (with crypt(3)). The user is then
authenticated if this encrypted password is identical to the second field of
the user's entry in the system password database (the /etc/passwd file). On
such systems, most if not all forms of privileges are granted based on this
single authentication scheme. Privilege comes in the form of a personal
user-identifier (UID) and membership of various groups. Services and
applications are available based on the personal and group identity of the
user. Traditionally, group membership has been assigned based on entries in the
/etc/group file.

It is the purpose of the Linux-PAM project to separate the development of
privilege granting software from the development of secure and appropriate
authentication schemes. This is accomplished by providing a library of
functions that an application may use to request that a user be authenticated.
This PAM library is configured locally with a system file, /etc/pam.conf (or a
series of configuration files located in /etc/pam.d/) to authenticate a user
request via the locally available authentication modules. The modules
themselves will usually be located in the directory /lib/security or /lib64/
security and take the form of dynamically loadable object files (see dlopen(3)
).

Chapter 2. Some comments on the text

Before proceeding to read the rest of this document, it should be noted that
the text assumes that certain files are placed in certain directories. Where
they have been specified, the conventions we adopt here for locating these
files are those of the relevant RFC (RFC-86.0, see bibliography"). If you are
using a distribution of Linux (or some other operating system) that supports
PAM but chooses to distribute these files in a different way you should be
careful when copying examples directly from the text.

As an example of the above, where it is explicit, the text assumes that PAM
loadable object files (the modules) are to be located in the following
directory: /lib/security/ or /lib64/security depending on the architecture.
This is generally the location that seems to be compatible with the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard (FHS). On Solaris, which has its own licensed version of
PAM, and some other implementations of UN*X, these files can be found in /usr/
lib/security. Please be careful to perform the necessary transcription when
using the examples from the text.

Chapter 3. Overview

For the uninitiated, we begin by considering an example. We take an application
that grants some service to users; login is one such program. Login does two
things, it first establishes that the requesting user is whom they claim to be
and second provides them with the requested service: in the case of login the
service is a command shell (bash, tcsh, zsh, etc.) running with the identity of
the user.

Traditionally, the former step is achieved by the login application prompting
the user for a password and then verifying that it agrees with that located on
the system; hence verifying that as far as the system is concerned the user is
who they claim to be. This is the task that is delegated to Linux-PAM.

From the perspective of the application programmer (in this case the person
that wrote the login application), Linux-PAM takes care of this authentication
task -- verifying the identity of the user.

The flexibility of Linux-PAM is that you, the system administrator, have the
freedom to stipulate which authentication scheme is to be used. You have the
freedom to set the scheme for any/all PAM-aware applications on your Linux
system. That is, you can authenticate from anything as naive as simple trust (
pam_permit) to something as paranoid as a combination of a retinal scan, a
voice print and a one-time password!

To illustrate the flexibility you face, consider the following situation: a
system administrator (parent) wishes to improve the mathematical ability of her
users (children). She can configure their favorite ``Shoot 'em up game''
(PAM-aware of course) to authenticate them with a request for the product of a
couple of random numbers less than 12. It is clear that if the game is any good
they will soon learn their multiplication tables. As they mature, the
authentication can be upgraded to include (long) division!

Linux-PAM deals with four separate types of (management) task. These are: 
authentication management; account management; session management; and password
management. The association of the preferred management scheme with the
behavior of an application is made with entries in the relevant Linux-PAM
configuration file. The management functions are performed by modules specified
in the configuration file. The syntax for this file is discussed in the section
below.

Here is a figure that describes the overall organization of Linux-PAM:

  +----------------+
  | application: X |
  +----------------+       /  +----------+     +================+
  | authentication-[---->--\--] Linux-   |--<--| PAM config file|
  |       +        [----<--/--]   PAM    |     |================|

  |                |  |      V     A

                         +---u-----u----+    |      |      |

                         +--------------+
                         |   acct....   |--[ b ]--[ d ]
                         +--------------+
                         |   password   |--[ b ]--[ c ]
                         +--------------+
                         |   session    |--[ e ]--[ c ]
                         +--------------+


By way of explanation, the left of the figure represents the application;
application X. Such an application interfaces with the Linux-PAM library and
knows none of the specifics of its configured authentication method. The 
Linux-PAM library (in the center) consults the contents of the PAM
configuration file and loads the modules that are appropriate for
application-X. These modules fall into one of four management groups
(lower-center) and are stacked in the order they appear in the configuration
file. These modules, when called by Linux-PAM, perform the various
authentication tasks for the application. Textual information, required from/or
offered to the user, can be exchanged through the use of the
application-supplied conversation function.

If a program is going to use PAM, then it has to have PAM functions explicitly
coded into the program. If you have access to the source code you can add the
appropriate PAM functions. If you do not have access to the source code, and
the binary does not have the PAM functions included, then it is not possible to
use PAM.

Chapter 4. The Linux-PAM configuration file

When a PAM aware privilege granting application is started, it activates its
attachment to the PAM-API. This activation performs a number of tasks, the most
important being the reading of the configuration file(s): /etc/pam.conf.
Alternatively, this may be the contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory. The
presence of this directory will cause Linux-PAM to ignore /etc/pam.conf.

These files list the PAMs that will do the authentication tasks required by
this service, and the appropriate behavior of the PAM-API in the event that
individual PAMs fail.

4.1. Configuration file syntax

The syntax of the /etc/pam.conf configuration file is as follows. The file is
made up of a list of rules, each rule is typically placed on a single line, but
may be extended with an escaped end of line: `\<LF>'. Comments are preceded
with `#' marks and extend to the next end of line.

The format of each rule is a space separated collection of tokens, the first
three being case-insensitive:

service type control module-path module-arguments

The syntax of files contained in the /etc/pam.d/ directory, are identical
except for the absence of any service field. In this case, the service is the
name of the file in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. This filename must be in lower
case.

An important feature of PAM, is that a number of rules may be stacked to
combine the services of a number of PAMs for a given authentication task.

The service is typically the familiar name of the corresponding application: 
login and su are good examples. The service-name, other, is reserved for giving
default rules. Only lines that mention the current service (or in the absence
of such, the other entries) will be associated with the given
service-application.

The type is the management group that the rule corresponds to. It is used to
specify which of the management groups the subsequent module is to be
associated with. Valid entries are:

account

    this module type performs non-authentication based account management. It
    is typically used to restrict/permit access to a service based on the time
    of day, currently available system resources (maximum number of users) or
    perhaps the location of the applicant user -- 'root' login only on the
    console.

auth

    this module type provides two aspects of authenticating the user. Firstly,
    it establishes that the user is who they claim to be, by instructing the
    application to prompt the user for a password or other means of
    identification. Secondly, the module can grant group membership or other
    privileges through its credential granting properties.

password

    this module type is required for updating the authentication token
    associated with the user. Typically, there is one module for each
    'challenge/response' based authentication (auth) type.

session

    this module type is associated with doing things that need to be done for
    the user before/after they can be given service. Such things include the
    logging of information concerning the opening/closing of some data exchange
    with a user, mounting directories, etc.

If the type value from the list above is prepended with a - character the PAM
library will not log to the system log if it is not possible to load the module
because it is missing in the system. This can be useful especially for modules
which are not always installed on the system and are not required for correct
authentication and authorization of the login session.

The third field, control, indicates the behavior of the PAM-API should the
module fail to succeed in its authentication task. There are two types of
syntax for this control field: the simple one has a single simple keyword; the
more complicated one involves a square-bracketed selection of value=action
pairs.

For the simple (historical) syntax valid control values are:

required

    failure of such a PAM will ultimately lead to the PAM-API returning failure
    but only after the remaining stacked modules (for this service and type)
    have been invoked.

requisite

    like required, however, in the case that such a module returns a failure,
    control is directly returned to the application or to the superior PAM
    stack. The return value is that associated with the first required or
    requisite module to fail. Note, this flag can be used to protect against
    the possibility of a user getting the opportunity to enter a password over
    an unsafe medium. It is conceivable that such behavior might inform an
    attacker of valid accounts on a system. This possibility should be weighed
    against the not insignificant concerns of exposing a sensitive password in
    a hostile environment.

sufficient

    if such a module succeeds and no prior required module has failed the PAM
    framework returns success to the application or to the superior PAM stack
    immediately without calling any further modules in the stack. A failure of
    a sufficient module is ignored and processing of the PAM module stack
    continues unaffected.

optional

    the success or failure of this module is only important if it is the only
    module in the stack associated with this service+type.

include

    include all lines of given type from the configuration file specified as an
    argument to this control.

substack

    include all lines of given type from the configuration file specified as an
    argument to this control. This differs from include in that evaluation of
    the done and die actions in a substack does not cause skipping the rest of
    the complete module stack, but only of the substack. Jumps in a substack
    also can not make evaluation jump out of it, and the whole substack is
    counted as one module when the jump is done in a parent stack. The reset
    action will reset the state of a module stack to the state it was in as of
    beginning of the substack evaluation.

For the more complicated syntax valid control values have the following form:

      [value1=action1 value2=action2 ...]


Where valueN corresponds to the return code from the function invoked in the
module for which the line is defined. It is selected from one of these: success
, open_err, symbol_err, service_err, system_err, buf_err, perm_denied, auth_err
, cred_insufficient, authinfo_unavail, user_unknown, maxtries, new_authtok_reqd
, acct_expired, session_err, cred_unavail, cred_expired, cred_err, 
no_module_data, conv_err, authtok_err, authtok_recover_err, authtok_lock_busy, 
authtok_disable_aging, try_again, ignore, abort, authtok_expired, 
module_unknown, bad_item, conv_again, incomplete, and default.

The last of these, default, implies 'all valueN's not mentioned explicitly.
Note, the full list of PAM errors is available in /usr/include/security/
_pam_types.h. The actionN can take one of the following forms:

ignore

    when used with a stack of modules, the module's return status will not
    contribute to the return code the application obtains.

bad

    this action indicates that the return code should be thought of as
    indicative of the module failing. If this module is the first in the stack
    to fail, its status value will be used for that of the whole stack.

die

    equivalent to bad with the side effect of terminating the module stack and
    PAM immediately returning to the application.

ok

    this tells PAM that the administrator thinks this return code should
    contribute directly to the return code of the full stack of modules. In
    other words, if the former state of the stack would lead to a return of 
    PAM_SUCCESS, the module's return code will override this value. Note, if
    the former state of the stack holds some value that is indicative of a
    modules failure, this 'ok' value will not be used to override that value.

done

    equivalent to ok with the side effect of terminating the module stack and
    PAM immediately returning to the application.

N (an unsigned integer)

    equivalent to ok with the side effect of jumping over the next N modules in
    the stack. Note that N equal to 0 is not allowed (and it would be identical
    to ok in such case).

reset

    clear all memory of the state of the module stack and start again with the
    next stacked module.

Each of the four keywords: required; requisite; sufficient; and optional, have
an equivalent expression in terms of the [...] syntax. They are as follows:

required

    [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=bad]

requisite

    [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=die]

sufficient

    [success=done new_authtok_reqd=done default=ignore]

optional

    [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok default=ignore]

module-path is either the full filename of the PAM to be used by the
application (it begins with a '/'), or a relative pathname from the default
module location: /lib/security/ or /lib64/security/, depending on the
architecture.

module-arguments are a space separated list of tokens that can be used to
modify the specific behavior of the given PAM. Such arguments will be
documented for each individual module. Note, if you wish to include spaces in
an argument, you should surround that argument with square brackets.

    squid auth required pam_mysql.so user=passwd_query passwd=mada \
          db=eminence [query=select user_name from internet_service \
          where user_name='%u' and password=PASSWORD('%p') and \
        service='web_proxy']


When using this convention, you can include `[' characters inside the string,
and if you wish to include a `]' character inside the string that will survive
the argument parsing, you should use `\]'. In other words:

    [..[..\]..]    -->   ..[..]..


Any line in (one of) the configuration file(s), that is not formatted
correctly, will generally tend (erring on the side of caution) to make the
authentication process fail. A corresponding error is written to the system log
files with a call to syslog(3).

4.2. Directory based configuration

More flexible than the single configuration file is it to configure libpam via
the contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory. In this case the directory is filled
with files each of which has a filename equal to a service-name (in
lower-case): it is the personal configuration file for the named service.

The syntax of each file in /etc/pam.d/ is similar to that of the /etc/pam.conf
file and is made up of lines of the following form:

type  control  module-path  module-arguments


The only difference being that the service-name is not present. The
service-name is of course the name of the given configuration file. For
example, /etc/pam.d/login contains the configuration for the login service.

4.3. Example configuration file entries

In this section, we give some examples of entries that can be present in the 
Linux-PAM configuration file. As a first attempt at configuring your system you
could do worse than to implement these.

If a system is to be considered secure, it had better have a reasonably secure
'other entry. The following is a paranoid setting (which is not a bad place to
start!):

#
# default; deny access
#
other   auth     required       pam_deny.so
other   account  required       pam_deny.so
other   password required       pam_deny.so
other   session  required       pam_deny.so


Whilst fundamentally a secure default, this is not very sympathetic to a
misconfigured system. For example, such a system is vulnerable to locking
everyone out should the rest of the file become badly written.

The module pam_deny (documented in a later section) is not very sophisticated.
For example, it logs no information when it is invoked so unless the users of a
system contact the administrator when failing to execute a service application,
the administrator may go for a long while in ignorance of the fact that his
system is misconfigured.

The addition of the following line before those in the above example would
provide a suitable warning to the administrator.

#
# default; wake up! This application is not configured
#
other   auth     required       pam_warn.so
other   password required       pam_warn.so


Having two 'other auth' lines is an example of stacking.

On a system that uses the /etc/pam.d/ configuration, the corresponding default
setup would be achieved with the following file:

#
# default configuration: /etc/pam.d/other
#
auth     required       pam_warn.so
auth     required       pam_deny.so
account  required       pam_deny.so
password required       pam_warn.so
password required       pam_deny.so
session  required       pam_deny.so


This is the only explicit example we give for an /etc/pam.d/ file. In general,
it should be clear how to transpose the remaining examples to this
configuration scheme.

On a less sensitive computer, one on which the system administrator wishes to
remain ignorant of much of the power of Linux-PAM, the following selection of
lines (in /etc/pam.d/other) is likely to mimic the historically familiar Linux
setup.

#
# default; standard UN*X access
#
auth     required       pam_unix.so
account  required       pam_unix.so
password required       pam_unix.so
session  required       pam_unix.so


In general this will provide a starting place for most applications.

Chapter 5. Security issues

5.1. If something goes wrong

Linux-PAM has the potential to seriously change the security of your system.
You can choose to have no security or absolute security (no access permitted).
In general, Linux-PAM errs towards the latter. Any number of configuration
errors can disable access to your system partially, or completely.

The most dramatic problem that is likely to be encountered when configuring 
Linux-PAM is that of deleting the configuration file(s): /etc/pam.d/* and/or /
etc/pam.conf. This will lock you out of your own system!

To recover, your best bet is to restore the system from a backup or boot the
system into a rescue system and correct things from there.

5.2. Avoid having a weak `other' configuration

It is not a good thing to have a weak default (other) entry. This service is
the default configuration for all PAM aware applications and if it is weak,
your system is likely to be vulnerable to attack.

Here is a sample "other" configuration file. The pam_deny module will deny
access and the pam_warn module will send a syslog message to auth.notice:

#
# The PAM configuration file for the `other' service
#
auth      required   pam_deny.so
auth      required   pam_warn.so
account   required   pam_deny.so
account   required   pam_warn.so
password  required   pam_deny.so
password  required   pam_warn.so
session   required   pam_deny.so
session   required   pam_warn.so


Chapter 6. A reference guide for available modules

Here, we collect together the descriptions of the various modules coming with
Linux-PAM.

6.1. pam_access - logdaemon style login access control

pam_access.so [ debug ] [ nodefgroup ] [ noaudit ] [ accessfile=file ] [
fieldsep=sep ] [ listsep=sep ]

6.1.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_access PAM module is mainly for access management. It provides
logdaemon style login access control based on login names, host or domain
names, internet addresses or network numbers, or on terminal line names, X
$DISPLAY values, or PAM service names in case of non-networked logins.

By default rules for access management are taken from config file /etc/security
/access.conf if you don't specify another file.

If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it
denies access based on origin (host, tty, etc.).

6.1.2. DESCRIPTION

The /etc/security/access.conf file specifies (user/group, host), (user/group,
network/netmask), (user/group, tty), (user/group, X-$DISPLAY-value), or (user/
group, pam-service-name) combinations for which a login will be either accepted
or refused.

When someone logs in, the file access.conf is scanned for the first entry that
matches the (user/group, host) or (user/group, network/netmask) combination,
or, in case of non-networked logins, the first entry that matches the (user/
group, tty) combination, or in the case of non-networked logins without a tty,
the first entry that matches the (user/group, X-$DISPLAY-value) or (user/group,
pam-service-name/) combination. The permissions field of that table entry
determines whether the login will be accepted or refused.

Each line of the login access control table has three fields separated by a ":"
character (colon):

permission:users/groups:origins

The first field, the permission field, can be either a "+" character (plus) for
access granted or a "-" character (minus) for access denied.

The second field, the users/group field, should be a list of one or more login
names, group names, or ALL (which always matches). To differentiate user
entries from group entries, group entries should be written with brackets, e.g.
(group).

The third field, the origins field, should be a list of one or more tty names
(for non-networked logins), X $DISPLAY values or PAM service names (for
non-networked logins without a tty), host names, domain names (begin with "."),
host addresses, internet network numbers (end with "."), internet network
addresses with network mask (where network mask can be a decimal number or an
internet address also), ALL (which always matches) or LOCAL. The LOCAL keyword
matches if and only if pam_get_item(3), when called with an item_type of 
PAM_RHOST, returns NULL or an empty string (and therefore the origins field is
compared against the return value of pam_get_item(3) called with an item_type
of PAM_TTY or, absent that, PAM_SERVICE).

If supported by the system you can use @netgroupname in host or user patterns.
The @@netgroupname syntax is supported in the user pattern only and it makes
the local system hostname to be passed to the netgroup match call in addition
to the user name. This might not work correctly on some libc implementations
causing the match to always fail.

The EXCEPT operator makes it possible to write very compact rules.

If the nodefgroup is not set, the group file is searched when a name does not
match that of the logged-in user. Only groups are matched in which users are
explicitly listed. However the PAM module does not look at the primary group id
of a user.

The "#" character at start of line (no space at front) can be used to mark this
line as a comment line.

6.1.3. OPTIONS

accessfile=/path/to/access.conf

    Indicate an alternative access.conf style configuration file to override
    the default. This can be useful when different services need different
    access lists.

debug

    A lot of debug information is printed with syslog(3).

noaudit

    Do not report logins from disallowed hosts and ttys to the audit subsystem.

fieldsep=separators

    This option modifies the field separator character that pam_access will
    recognize when parsing the access configuration file. For example: fieldsep
    =| will cause the default `:' character to be treated as part of a field
    value and `|' becomes the field separator. Doing this may be useful in
    conjunction with a system that wants to use pam_access with X based
    applications, since the PAM_TTY item is likely to be of the form
    "hostname:0" which includes a `:' character in its value. But you should
    not need this.

listsep=separators

    This option modifies the list separator character that pam_access will
    recognize when parsing the access configuration file. For example: listsep
    =, will cause the default ` ' (space) and `\t' (tab) characters to be
    treated as part of a list element value and `,' becomes the only list
    element separator. Doing this may be useful on a system with group
    information obtained from a Windows domain, where the default built-in
    groups "Domain Users", "Domain Admins" contain a space.

nodefgroup

    User tokens which are not enclosed in parentheses will not be matched
    against the group database. The backwards compatible default is to try the
    group database match even for tokens not enclosed in parentheses.

6.1.4. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

All module types (auth, account, password and session) are provided.

6.1.5. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    Access was granted.

PAM_PERM_DENIED

    Access was not granted.

PAM_IGNORE

    pam_setcred was called which does nothing.

PAM_ABORT

    Not all relevant data or options could be gotten.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    The user is not known to the system.

6.1.6. FILES

/etc/security/access.conf

    Default configuration file

6.1.7. EXAMPLES

These are some example lines which might be specified in /etc/security/
access.conf.

User root should be allowed to get access via cron, X11 terminal :0, tty1, ...,
tty5, tty6.

+ : root : crond :0 tty1 tty2 tty3 tty4 tty5 tty6

User root should be allowed to get access from hosts which own the IPv4
addresses. This does not mean that the connection have to be a IPv4 one, a IPv6
connection from a host with one of this IPv4 addresses does work, too.

+ : root : 192.168.200.1 192.168.200.4 192.168.200.9

+ : root : 127.0.0.1

User root should get access from network 192.168.201. where the term will be
evaluated by string matching. But it might be better to use network/netmask
instead. The same meaning of 192.168.201. is 192.168.201.0/24 or 192.168.201.0/
255.255.255.0.

+ : root : 192.168.201.

User root should be able to have access from hosts foo1.bar.org and 
foo2.bar.org (uses string matching also).

+ : root : foo1.bar.org foo2.bar.org

User root should be able to have access from domain foo.bar.org (uses string
matching also).

+ : root : .foo.bar.org

User root should be denied to get access from all other sources.

- : root : ALL

User foo and members of netgroup admins should be allowed to get access from
all sources. This will only work if netgroup service is available.

+ : @admins foo : ALL

User john and foo should get access from IPv6 host address.

+ : john foo : 2001:db8:0:101::1

User john should get access from IPv6 net/mask.

+ : john : 2001:db8:0:101::/64

Disallow console logins to all but the shutdown, sync and all other accounts,
which are a member of the wheel group.

-:ALL EXCEPT (wheel) shutdown sync:LOCAL

All other users should be denied to get access from all sources.

- : ALL : ALL

6.2. pam_cracklib - checks the password against dictionary words

pam_cracklib.so [ ... ]

6.2.1. DESCRIPTION

This module can be plugged into the password stack of a given application to
provide some plug-in strength-checking for passwords.

The action of this module is to prompt the user for a password and check its
strength against a system dictionary and a set of rules for identifying poor
choices.

The first action is to prompt for a single password, check its strength and
then, if it is considered strong, prompt for the password a second time (to
verify that it was typed correctly on the first occasion). All being well, the
password is passed on to subsequent modules to be installed as the new
authentication token.

The strength checks works in the following manner: at first the Cracklib
routine is called to check if the password is part of a dictionary; if this is
not the case an additional set of strength checks is done. These checks are:

Palindrome

    Is the new password a palindrome?

Case Change Only

    Is the new password the the old one with only a change of case?

Similar

    Is the new password too much like the old one? This is primarily controlled
    by one argument, difok which is a number of character changes (inserts,
    removals, or replacements) between the old and new password that are enough
    to accept the new password. This defaults to 5 changes.

Simple

    Is the new password too small? This is controlled by 6 arguments minlen,
    maxclassrepeat, dcredit, ucredit, lcredit, and ocredit. See the section on
    the arguments for the details of how these work and there defaults.

Rotated

    Is the new password a rotated version of the old password?

Same consecutive characters

    Optional check for same consecutive characters.

Too long monotonic character sequence

    Optional check for too long monotonic character sequence.

Contains user name

    Optional check whether the password contains the user's name in some form.

This module with no arguments will work well for standard unix password
encryption. With md5 encryption, passwords can be longer than 8 characters and
the default settings for this module can make it hard for the user to choose a
satisfactory new password. Notably, the requirement that the new password
contain no more than 1/2 of the characters in the old password becomes a
non-trivial constraint. For example, an old password of the form "the quick
brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs" would be difficult to change... In
addition, the default action is to allow passwords as small as 5 characters in
length. For a md5 systems it can be a good idea to increase the required
minimum size of a password. One can then allow more credit for different kinds
of characters but accept that the new password may share most of these
characters with the old password.

6.2.2. OPTIONS

debug

    This option makes the module write information to syslog(3) indicating the
    behavior of the module (this option does not write password information to
    the log file).

authtok_type=XXX

    The default action is for the module to use the following prompts when
    requesting passwords: "New UNIX password: " and "Retype UNIX password: ".
    The example word UNIX can be replaced with this option, by default it is
    empty.

retry=N

    Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1.

difok=N

    This argument will change the default of 5 for the number of character
    changes in the new password that differentiate it from the old password.

minlen=N

    The minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are
    not disabled which is the default). In addition to the number of characters
    in the new password, credit (of +1 in length) is given for each different
    kind of character (other, upper, lower and digit). The default for this
    parameter is 9 which is good for a old style UNIX password all of the same
    type of character but may be too low to exploit the added security of a md5
    system. Note that there is a pair of length limits in Cracklib itself, a
    "way too short" limit of 4 which is hard coded in and a defined limit (6)
    that will be checked without reference to minlen. If you want to allow
    passwords as short as 5 characters you should not use this module.

dcredit=N

    (N >= 0) This is the maximum credit for having digits in the new password.
    If you have less than or N digits, each digit will count +1 towards meeting
    the current minlen value. The default for dcredit is 1 which is the
    recommended value for minlen less than 10.

    (N < 0) This is the minimum number of digits that must be met for a new
    password.

ucredit=N

    (N >= 0) This is the maximum credit for having upper case letters in the
    new password. If you have less than or N upper case letters each letter
    will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value. The default for
    ucredit is 1 which is the recommended value for minlen less than 10.

    (N < 0) This is the minimum number of upper case letters that must be met
    for a new password.

lcredit=N

    (N >= 0) This is the maximum credit for having lower case letters in the
    new password. If you have less than or N lower case letters, each letter
    will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value. The default for
    lcredit is 1 which is the recommended value for minlen less than 10.

    (N < 0) This is the minimum number of lower case letters that must be met
    for a new password.

ocredit=N

    (N >= 0) This is the maximum credit for having other characters in the new
    password. If you have less than or N other characters, each character will
    count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value. The default for ocredit
    is 1 which is the recommended value for minlen less than 10.

    (N < 0) This is the minimum number of other characters that must be met for
    a new password.

minclass=N

    The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password.
    The default number is zero. The four classes are digits, upper and lower
    letters and other characters. The difference to the credit check is that a
    specific class if of characters is not required. Instead N out of four of
    the classes are required.

maxrepeat=N

    Reject passwords which contain more than N same consecutive characters. The
    default is 0 which means that this check is disabled.

maxsequence=N

    Reject passwords which contain monotonic character sequences longer than N.
    The default is 0 which means that this check is disabled. Examples of such
    sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not
    pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the
    password.

maxclassrepeat=N

    Reject passwords which contain more than N consecutive characters of the
    same class. The default is 0 which means that this check is disabled.

reject_username

    Check whether the name of the user in straight or reversed form is
    contained in the new password. If it is found the new password is rejected.

gecoscheck

    Check whether the words from the GECOS field (usualy full name of the user)
    longer than 3 characters in straight or reversed form are contained in the
    new password. If any such word is found the new password is rejected.

enforce_for_root

    The module will return error on failed check also if the user changing the
    password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the
    message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password
    anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that
    compare the old and new password are not performed.

use_authtok

    This argument is used to force the module to not prompt the user for a new
    password but use the one provided by the previously stacked password
    module.

dictpath=/path/to/dict

    Path to the cracklib dictionaries.

6.2.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the password module type is provided.

6.2.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The new password passes all checks.

PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR

    No new password was entered, the username could not be determined or the
    new password fails the strength checks.

PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR

    The old password was not supplied by a previous stacked module or got not
    requested from the user. The first error can happen if use_authtok is
    specified.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    A internal error occurred.

6.2.5. EXAMPLES

For an example of the use of this module, we show how it may be stacked with
the password component of pam_unix(8)

#
# These lines stack two password type modules. In this example the
# user is given 3 opportunities to enter a strong password. The
# "use_authtok" argument ensures that the pam_unix module does not
# prompt for a password, but instead uses the one provided by
# pam_cracklib.
#
passwd  password required       pam_cracklib.so retry=3
passwd  password required       pam_unix.so use_authtok


Another example (in the /etc/pam.d/passwd format) is for the case that you want
to use md5 password encryption:

#%PAM-1.0
#
# These lines allow a md5 systems to support passwords of at least 14
# bytes with extra credit of 2 for digits and 2 for others the new
# password must have at least three bytes that are not present in the
# old password
#
password  required pam_cracklib.so \
               difok=3 minlen=15 dcredit= 2 ocredit=2
password  required pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5


And here is another example in case you don't want to use credits:

#%PAM-1.0
#
# These lines require the user to select a password with a minimum
# length of 8 and with at least 1 digit number, 1 upper case letter,
# and 1 other character
#
password  required pam_cracklib.so \
               dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=0 minlen=8
password  required pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5

6.6. pam_env - set/unset environment variables

pam_env.so [ debug ] [ conffile=conf-file ] [ envfile=env-file ] [ readenv=0|1
] [ user_envfile=env-file ] [ user_readenv=0|1 ]

6.6.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_env PAM module allows the (un)setting of environment variables.
Supported is the use of previously set environment variables as well as 
PAM_ITEMs such as PAM_RHOST.

By default rules for (un)setting of variables are taken from the config file /
etc/security/pam_env.conf. An alternate file can be specified with the conffile
option.

Second a file (/etc/environment by default) with simple KEY=VAL pairs on
separate lines will be read. With the envfile option an alternate file can be
specified. And with the readenv option this can be completly disabled.

Third it will read a user configuration file ($HOME/.pam_environment by
default). The default file file can be changed with the user_envfile option and
it can be turned on and off with the user_readenv option.

Since setting of PAM environment variables can have side effects to other
modules, this module should be the last one on the stack.

6.6.2. DESCRIPTION

The /etc/security/pam_env.conf file specifies the environment variables to be
set, unset or modified by pam_env(8). When someone logs in, this file is read
and the environment variables are set according.

Each line starts with the variable name, there are then two possible options
for each variable DEFAULT and OVERRIDE. DEFAULT allows and administrator to set
the value of the variable to some default value, if none is supplied then the
empty string is assumed. The OVERRIDE option tells pam_env that it should enter
in its value (overriding the default value) if there is one to use. OVERRIDE is
not used, "" is assumed and no override will be done.

VARIABLE [DEFAULT=[value]] [OVERRIDE=[value]]

(Possibly non-existent) environment variables may be used in values using the $
{string} syntax and (possibly non-existent) PAM_ITEMs as well as HOME and SHELL
may be used in values using the @{string} syntax. Both the $ and @ characters
can be backslash escaped to be used as literal values values can be delimited
with "", escaped " not supported. Note that many environment variables that you
would like to use may not be set by the time the module is called. For example,
${HOME} is used below several times, but many PAM applications don't make it
available by the time you need it. The special variables @{HOME} and @{SHELL}
are expanded to the values for the user from his passwd entry.

The "#" character at start of line (no space at front) can be used to mark this
line as a comment line.

6.6.3. OPTIONS

conffile=/path/to/pam_env.conf

    Indicate an alternative pam_env.conf style configuration file to override
    the default. This can be useful when different services need different
    environments.

debug

    A lot of debug information is printed with syslog(3).

envfile=/path/to/environment

    Indicate an alternative environment file to override the default. The
    syntax are simple KEY=VAL pairs on separate lines. The export instruction
    can be specified for bash compatibility, but will be ignored. This can be
    useful when different services need different environments.

readenv=0|1

    Turns on or off the reading of the file specified by envfile (0 is off, 1
    is on). By default this option is on.

user_envfile=filename

    Indicate an alternative .pam_environment file to override the default.The
    syntax is the same as for /etc/environment. The filename is relative to the
    user home directory. This can be useful when different services need
    different environments.

user_readenv=0|1

    Turns on or off the reading of the user specific environment file. 0 is
    off, 1 is on. By default this option is on.

6.6.4. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and session module types are provided.

6.6.5. RETURN VALUES

PAM_ABORT

    Not all relevant data or options could be gotten.

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_IGNORE

    No pam_env.conf and environment file was found.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Environment variables were set.

6.6.6. FILES

/etc/security/pam_env.conf

    Default configuration file

/etc/environment

    Default environment file

$HOME/.pam_environment

    User specific environment file

6.6.7. EXAMPLES

These are some example lines which might be specified in /etc/security/
pam_env.conf.

Set the REMOTEHOST variable for any hosts that are remote, default to
"localhost" rather than not being set at all

      REMOTEHOST     DEFAULT=localhost OVERRIDE=@{PAM_RHOST}


Set the DISPLAY variable if it seems reasonable

      DISPLAY        DEFAULT=${REMOTEHOST}:0.0 OVERRIDE=${DISPLAY}


Now some simple variables

      PAGER          DEFAULT=less
      MANPAGER       DEFAULT=less
      LESS           DEFAULT="M q e h15 z23 b80"
      NNTPSERVER     DEFAULT=localhost
      PATH           DEFAULT=${HOME}/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin\
      :/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin/X11:/usr/bin/X11
      XDG_DATA_HOME  @{HOME}/share/


Silly examples of escaped variables, just to show how they work.

      DOLLAR         DEFAULT=\$
      DOLLARDOLLAR   DEFAULT=        OVERRIDE=\$${DOLLAR}

6.7. pam_exec - call an external command

pam_exec.so [ debug ] [ expose_authtok ] [ seteuid ] [ quiet ] [ stdout ] [ log
=file ] [ type=type ] command [ ... ]

6.7.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_exec is a PAM module that can be used to run an external command.

The child's environment is set to the current PAM environment list, as returned
by pam_getenvlist(3) In addition, the following PAM items are exported as
environment variables: PAM_RHOST, PAM_RUSER, PAM_SERVICE, PAM_TTY, PAM_USER and
PAM_TYPE, which contains one of the module types: account, auth, password,
open_session and close_session.

Commands called by pam_exec need to be aware of that the user can have controll
over the environment.

6.7.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

expose_authtok

    During authentication the calling command can read the password from stdin
    (3). Only first PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE bytes of a password are provided to the
    command.

log=file

    The output of the command is appended to file

type=type

    Only run the command if the module type matches the given type.

stdout

    Per default the output of the executed command is written to /dev/null.
    With this option, the stdout output of the executed command is redirected
    to the calling application. It's in the responsibility of this application
    what happens with the output. The log option is ignored.

quiet

    Per default pam_exec.so will echo the exit status of the external command
    if it fails. Specifying this option will suppress the message.

seteuid

    Per default pam_exec.so will execute the external command with the real
    user ID of the calling process. Specifying this option means the command is
    run with the effective user ID.

6.7.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

6.9. pam_filter - filter module

pam_filter.so [ debug ] [ new_term ] [ non_term ] run1|run2 filter [ ... ]

6.9.1. DESCRIPTION

This module is intended to be a platform for providing access to all of the
input/output that passes between the user and the application. It is only
suitable for tty-based and (stdin/stdout) applications.

To function this module requires filters to be installed on the system. The
single filter provided with the module simply transposes upper and lower case
letters in the input and output streams. (This can be very annoying and is not
kind to termcap based editors).

Each component of the module has the potential to invoke the desired filter.
The filter is always execv(2) with the privilege of the calling application and
not that of the user. For this reason it cannot usually be killed by the user
without closing their session.

6.9.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

new_term

    The default action of the filter is to set the PAM_TTY item to indicate the
    terminal that the user is using to connect to the application. This
    argument indicates that the filter should set PAM_TTY to the filtered
    pseudo-terminal.

non_term

    don't try to set the PAM_TTY item.

runX

    In order that the module can invoke a filter it should know when to invoke
    it. This argument is required to tell the filter when to do this.

    Permitted values for X are 1 and 2. These indicate the precise time that
    the filter is to be run. To understand this concept it will be useful to
    have read the pam(3) manual page. Basically, for each management group
    there are up to two ways of calling the module's functions. In the case of
    the authentication and session components there are actually two separate
    functions. For the case of authentication, these functions are 
    pam_authenticate(3) and pam_setcred(3), here run1 means run the filter from
    the pam_authenticate function and run2 means run the filter from
    pam_setcred. In the case of the session modules, run1 implies that the
    filter is invoked at the pam_open_session(3) stage, and run2 for 
    pam_close_session(3).

    For the case of the account component. Either run1 or run2 may be used.

    For the case of the password component, run1 is used to indicate that the
    filter is run on the first occasion of pam_chauthtok(3) (the 
    PAM_PRELIM_CHECK phase) and run2 is used to indicate that the filter is run
    on the second occasion (the PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK phase).

filter

    The full pathname of the filter to be run and any command line arguments
    that the filter might expect.

6.9.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

All module types (auth, account, password and session) are provided.

6.9.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The new filter was set successfully.

PAM_ABORT

    Critical error, immediate abort.

6.9.5. EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to see how to configure login to
transpose upper and lower case letters once the user has logged in:

        session required pam_filter.so run1 /lib/security/pam_filter/upperLOWER

6.10. pam_ftp - module for anonymous access

pam_ftp.so [ debug ] [ ignore ] [ users=XXX,YYY, ...]

6.10.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_ftp is a PAM module which provides a pluggable anonymous ftp mode of
access.

This module intercepts the user's name and password. If the name is ftp or 
anonymous, the user's password is broken up at the @ delimiter into a PAM_RUSER
and a PAM_RHOST part; these pam-items being set accordingly. The username (
PAM_USER) is set to ftp. In this case the module succeeds. Alternatively, the
module sets the PAM_AUTHTOK item with the entered password and fails.

This module is not safe and easily spoofable.

6.10.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

ignore

    Pay no attention to the email address of the user (if supplied).

ftp=XXX,YYY,...

    Instead of ftp or anonymous, provide anonymous login to the comma separated
    list of users: XXX,YYY,.... Should the applicant enter one of these
    usernames the returned username is set to the first in the list: XXX.

6.10.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the auth module type is provided.

6.10.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The authentication was successful.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

6.10.5. EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/ftpd to handle ftp style anonymous login:

#
# ftpd; add ftp-specifics. These lines enable anonymous ftp over
#       standard UN*X access (the listfile entry blocks access to
#       users listed in /etc/ftpusers)
#
auth    sufficient  pam_ftp.so
auth    required    pam_unix.so use_first_pass
auth    required    pam_listfile.so \

6.11. pam_group - module to modify group access

pam_group.so

6.11.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it grants
group memberships (in the credential setting phase of the authentication
module) to the user. Such memberships are based on the service they are
applying for.

By default rules for group memberships are taken from config file /etc/security
/group.conf.

This module's usefulness relies on the file-systems accessible to the user. The
point being that once granted the membership of a group, the user may attempt
to create a setgid binary with a restricted group ownership. Later, when the
user is not given membership to this group, they can recover group membership
with the precompiled binary. The reason that the file-systems that the user has
access to are so significant, is the fact that when a system is mounted nosuid
the user is unable to create or execute such a binary file. For this module to
provide any level of security, all file-systems that the user has write access
to should be mounted nosuid.

The pam_group module functions in parallel with the /etc/group file. If the
user is granted any groups based on the behavior of this module, they are
granted in addition to those entries /etc/group (or equivalent).

6.11.2. DESCRIPTION

The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it grants
group memberships (in the credential setting phase of the authentication
module) to the user. Such memberships are based on the service they are
applying for.

For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly formatted /etc/
security/group.conf file present. White spaces are ignored and lines maybe
extended with '\' (escaped newlines). Text following a '#' is ignored to the
end of the line.

The syntax of the lines is as follows:

services;ttys;users;times;groups

The first field, the services field, is a logic list of PAM service names that
the rule applies to.

The second field, the tty field, is a logic list of terminal names that this
rule applies to.

The third field, the users field, is a logic list of users, or a UNIX group, or
a netgroup of users to whom this rule applies. Group names are preceded by a
'%' symbol, while netgroup names are preceded by a '@' symbol.

For these items the simple wildcard '*' may be used only once. With UNIX groups
or netgroups no wildcards or logic operators are allowed.

The times field is used to indicate "when" these groups are to be given to the
user. The format here is a logic list of day/time-range entries. The days are
specified by a sequence of two character entries, MoTuSa for example is Monday
Tuesday and Saturday. Note that repeated days are unset MoMo = no day, and MoWk
= all weekdays bar Monday. The two character combinations accepted are Mo Tu We
Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd Al, the last two being week-end days and all 7 days of the
week respectively. As a final example, AlFr means all days except Friday.

Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a '!' to indicate "anything but". The
time-range part is two 24-hour times HHMM, separated by a hyphen, indicating
the start and finish time (if the finish time is smaller than the start time it
is deemed to apply on the following day).

The groups field is a comma or space separated list of groups that the user
inherits membership of. These groups are added if the previous fields are
satisfied by the user's request.

For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be satisfied by the
applying process.

6.11.3. OPTIONS

This module does not recognise any options.

6.11.4. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the auth module type is provided.

6.11.5. RETURN VALUES

\U

    same as \u except it is suffixed with "user" or "users" (eg. "1 user" or
    "10 users")

\v

    operating system version and build date (uname -v)

6.12.2. OPTIONS

noesc

    Turns off escape code parsing.

issue=issue-file-name

6.13. pam_keyinit - display the keyinit file

pam_keyinit.so [ debug ] [ force ] [ revoke ]

6.13.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_keyinit PAM module ensures that the invoking process has a session
keyring other than the user default session keyring.

The session component of the module checks to see if the process's session
keyring is the user default, and, if it is, creates a new anonymous session
keyring with which to replace it.

If a new session keyring is created, it will install a link to the user common
keyring in the session keyring so that keys common to the user will be
automatically accessible through it.

The session keyring of the invoking process will thenceforth be inherited by
all its children unless they override it.

This module is intended primarily for use by login processes. Be aware that
after the session keyring has been replaced, the old session keyring and the
keys it contains will no longer be accessible.

This module should not, generally, be invoked by programs like su, since it is
usually desirable for the key set to percolate through to the alternate
context. The keys have their own permissions system to manage this.

This module should be included as early as possible in a PAM configuration, so
that other PAM modules can attach tokens to the keyring.

The keyutils package is used to manipulate keys more directly. This can be
obtained from:

Keyutils

6.13.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Log debug information with syslog(3).

force

    Causes the session keyring of the invoking process to be replaced
    unconditionally.

revoke

    Causes the session keyring of the invoking process to be revoked when the
    invoking process exits if the session keyring was created for this process
    in the first place.

6.13.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the session module type is provided.

6.13.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    This module will usually return this value

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    Authentication failure.

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_IGNORE

    The return value should be ignored by PAM dispatch.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    Cannot determine the user name.

PAM_SESSION_ERR

    This module will return this value if its arguments are invalid or if a
    system error such as ENOMEM occurs.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

6.13.5. EXAMPLES

Add this line to your login entries to start each login session with its own
session keyring:

session  required  pam_keyinit.so


This will prevent keys from one session leaking into another session for the
same user.

6.14. pam_lastlog - display date of last login

pam_lastlog.so [ debug ] [ silent ] [ never ] [ nodate ] [ nohost ] [ noterm ]
[ nowtmp ] [ noupdate ] [ showfailed ] [ inactive=<days> ]

6.14.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_lastlog is a PAM module to display a line of information about the last
login of the user. In addition, the module maintains the /var/log/lastlog file.

Some applications may perform this function themselves. In such cases, this
module is not necessary.

If the module is called in the auth or account phase, the accounts that were
not used recently enough will be disallowed to log in. The check is not
performed for the root account so the root is never locked out.

6.14.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

silent

    Don't inform the user about any previous login, just update the /var/log/
    lastlog file.

never

    If the /var/log/lastlog file does not contain any old entries for the user,
    indicate that the user has never previously logged in with a welcome
    message.

nodate

    Don't display the date of the last login.

noterm

    Don't display the terminal name on which the last login was attempted.

nohost

    Don't indicate from which host the last login was attempted.

nowtmp

    Don't update the wtmp entry.

noupdate

    Don't update any file.

showfailed

    Display number of failed login attempts and the date of the last failed
    attempt from btmp. The date is not displayed when nodate is specified.

inactive=<days>

    This option is specific for the auth or account phase. It specifies the
    number of days after the last login of the user when the user will be
    locked out by the module. The default value is 90.

6.14.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and account module type allows to lock out users which did not login
recently enough. The session module type is provided for displaying the
information about the last login and/or updating the lastlog and wtmp files.

6.14.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    Everything was successful.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    Internal service module error.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    User locked out in the auth or account phase due to inactivity.

PAM_IGNORE

    There was an error during reading the lastlog file in the auth or account
    phase and thus inactivity of the user cannot be determined.

6.14.5. EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to display the last login time of an
user:

    session  required  pam_lastlog.so nowtmp


To reject the user if he did not login during the previous 50 days the
following line can be used:

    auth  required  pam_lastlog.so inactive=50

6.15. pam_limits - limit resources

pam_limits.so [ conf=/path/to/limits.conf ] [ debug ] [ set_all ] [ utmp_early
] [ noaudit ]

6.15.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_limits PAM module sets limits on the system resources that can be
obtained in a user-session. Users of uid=0 are affected by this limits, too.

By default limits are taken from the /etc/security/limits.conf config file.
Then individual *.conf files from the /etc/security/limits.d/ directory are
read. The files are parsed one after another in the order of "C" locale. The
effect of the individual files is the same as if all the files were
concatenated together in the order of parsing. If a config file is explicitly
specified with a module option then the files in the above directory are not
parsed.

The module must not be called by a multithreaded application.

If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it
denies access based on limit of maximum number of concurrent login sessions.

6.15.2. DESCRIPTION

The pam_limits.so module applies ulimit limits, nice priority and number of
simultaneous login sessions limit to user login sessions. This description of
the configuration file syntax applies to the /etc/security/limits.conf file and
*.conf files in the /etc/security/limits.d directory.

The syntax of the lines is as follows:

<domain> <type> <item> <value>

The fields listed above should be filled as follows:

<domain>
      + a username

      + a groupname, with @group syntax. This should not be confused with
        netgroups.

      + the wildcard *, for default entry.

      + the wildcard %, for maxlogins limit only, can also be used with %group
        syntax. If the % wildcard is used alone it is identical to using * with
        maxsyslogins limit. With a group specified after % it limits the total
        number of logins of all users that are member of the group.

      + an uid range specified as <min_uid>:<max_uid>. If min_uid is omitted,
        the match is exact for the max_uid. If max_uid is omitted, all uids
        greater than or equal min_uid match.

      + a gid range specified as @<min_gid>:<max_gid>. If min_gid is omitted,
        the match is exact for the max_gid. If max_gid is omitted, all gids
        greater than or equal min_gid match. For the exact match all groups
        including the user's supplementary groups are examined. For the range
        matches only the user's primary group is examined.

      + a gid specified as %:<gid> applicable to maxlogins limit only. It
        limits the total number of logins of all users that are member of the
        group with the specified gid.

<type>

    hard

        for enforcing hard resource limits. These limits are set by the
        superuser and enforced by the Kernel. The user cannot raise his
        requirement of system resources above such values.

    soft

        for enforcing soft resource limits. These limits are ones that the user
        can move up or down within the permitted range by any pre-existing hard
        limits. The values specified with this token can be thought of as 
        default values, for normal system usage.

    -

        for enforcing both soft and hard resource limits together.

        Note, if you specify a type of '-' but neglect to supply the item and
        value fields then the module will never enforce any limits on the
        specified user/group etc. .

<item>

    core

        limits the core file size (KB)

    data

        maximum data size (KB)

    fsize

        maximum filesize (KB)

    memlock

        maximum locked-in-memory address space (KB)

    nofile

        maximum number of open file descriptors

    rss

        maximum resident set size (KB) (Ignored in Linux 2.4.30 and higher)

    stack

        maximum stack size (KB)

    cpu

        maximum CPU time (minutes)

    nproc

        maximum number of processes

    as

        address space limit (KB)

    maxlogins

        maximum number of logins for this user (this limit does not apply to
        user with uid=0)

    maxsyslogins

        maximum number of all logins on system; user is not allowed to log-in
        if total number of all user logins is greater than specified number
        (this limit does not apply to user with uid=0)

    priority

        the priority to run user process with (negative values boost process
        priority)

    locks

        maximum locked files (Linux 2.4 and higher)

    sigpending

        maximum number of pending signals (Linux 2.6 and higher)

    msgqueue

        maximum memory used by POSIX message queues (bytes) (Linux 2.6 and
        higher)

    nice

        maximum nice priority allowed to raise to (Linux 2.6.12 and higher)
        values: [-20,19]

    rtprio

        maximum realtime priority allowed for non-privileged processes (Linux
        2.6.12 and higher)

All items support the values -1, unlimited or infinity indicating no limit,
except for priority and nice.

If a hard limit or soft limit of a resource is set to a valid value, but
outside of the supported range of the local system, the system may reject the
new limit or unexpected behavior may occur. If the control value required is
used, the module will reject the login if a limit could not be set.

In general, individual limits have priority over group limits, so if you impose
no limits for admin group, but one of the members in this group have a limits
line, the user will have its limits set according to this line.

Also, please note that all limit settings are set per login. They are not
global, nor are they permanent; existing only for the duration of the session.
One exception is the maxlogin option, this one is system wide. But there is a
race, concurrent logins at the same time will not always be detect as such but
only counted as one.

In the limits configuration file, the '#' character introduces a comment -
after which the rest of the line is ignored.

The pam_limits module does report configuration problems found in its
configuration file and errors via syslog(3).

6.15.3. OPTIONS

conf=/path/to/limits.conf

    Indicate an alternative limits.conf style configuration file to override
    the default.

debug

    Print debug information.

set_all

    Set the limits for which no value is specified in the configuration file to
    the one from the process with the PID 1.

utmp_early

    Some broken applications actually allocate a utmp entry for the user before
    the user is admitted to the system. If some of the services you are
    configuring PAM for do this, you can selectively use this module argument
    to compensate for this behavior and at the same time maintain system-wide
    consistency with a single limits.conf file.

noaudit

    Do not report exceeded maximum logins count to the audit subsystem.

6.16. pam_listfile - deny or allow services based on an arbitrary file

pam_listfile.so item=[tty|user|rhost|ruser|group|shell] sense=[allow|deny] file
=/path/filename onerr=[succeed|fail] [ apply=[user|@group] ] [ quiet ]

6.16.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_listfile is a PAM module which provides a way to deny or allow services
based on an arbitrary file.

The module gets the item of the type specified -- user specifies the username, 
PAM_USER; tty specifies the name of the terminal over which the request has
been made, PAM_TTY; rhost specifies the name of the remote host (if any) from
which the request was made, PAM_RHOST; and ruser specifies the name of the
remote user (if available) who made the request, PAM_RUSER -- and looks for an
instance of that item in the file=filename. filename contains one line per item
listed. If the item is found, then if sense=allow, PAM_SUCCESS is returned,
causing the authorization request to succeed; else if sense=deny, PAM_AUTH_ERR
is returned, causing the authorization request to fail.

If an error is encountered (for instance, if filename does not exist, or a
poorly-constructed argument is encountered), then if onerr=succeed, PAM_SUCCESS
is returned, otherwise if onerr=fail, PAM_AUTH_ERR or PAM_SERVICE_ERR (as
appropriate) will be returned.

An additional argument, apply=, can be used to restrict the application of the
above to a specific user (apply=username) or a given group (apply=@groupname).
This added restriction is only meaningful when used with the tty, rhost and 
shell items.

Besides this last one, all arguments should be specified; do not count on any
default behavior.

No credentials are awarded by this module.

6.16.2. OPTIONS

item=[tty|user|rhost|ruser|group|shell]

    What is listed in the file and should be checked for.

sense=[allow|deny]

    Action to take if found in file, if the item is NOT found in the file, then
    the opposite action is requested.

file=/path/filename

    File containing one item per line. The file needs to be a plain file and
    not world writable.

onerr=[succeed|fail]

    What to do if something weird happens like being unable to open the file.

apply=[user|@group]

    Restrict the user class for which the restriction apply. Note that with
    item=[user|ruser|group] this does not make sense, but for item=[tty|rhost|
    shell] it have a meaning.

quiet

    Do not treat service refusals or missing list files as errors that need to
    be logged.

6.16.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

All module types (auth, account, password and session) are provided.

6.16.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    Authentication failure.

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_IGNORE

    The rule does not apply to the apply option.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    Error in service module.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Success.

6.16.5. EXAMPLES

Classic 'ftpusers' authentication can be implemented with this entry in /etc/
pam.d/ftpd:

#
# deny ftp-access to users listed in the /etc/ftpusers file
#
auth    required       pam_listfile.so \
        onerr=succeed item=user sense=deny file=/etc/ftpusers


Note, users listed in /etc/ftpusers file are (counterintuitively) not allowed
access to the ftp service.

To allow login access only for certain users, you can use a /etc/pam.d/login
entry like this:

#
# permit login to users listed in /etc/loginusers
#
auth    required       pam_listfile.so \
        onerr=fail item=user sense=allow file=/etc/loginusers


For this example to work, all users who are allowed to use the login service
should be listed in the file /etc/loginusers. Unless you are explicitly trying
to lock out root, make sure that when you do this, you leave a way for root to
log in, either by listing root in /etc/loginusers, or by listing a user who is
able to su to the root account.

6.17. pam_localuser - require users to be listed in /etc/passwd

pam_localuser.so [ debug ] [ file=/path/passwd ]

6.17.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_localuser is a PAM module to help implementing site-wide login policies,
where they typically include a subset of the network's users and a few accounts
that are local to a particular workstation. Using pam_localuser and pam_wheel
or pam_listfile is an effective way to restrict access to either local users
and/or a subset of the network's users.

This could also be implemented using pam_listfile.so and a very short awk
script invoked by cron, but it's common enough to have been separated out.

6.17.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

file=/path/passwd

    Use a file other than /etc/passwd.

6.17.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

All module types (account, auth, password and session) are provided.

6.17.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The new localuser was set successfully.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    No username was given.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

6.17.5. EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/su to allow only local users in group
wheel to use su.

account sufficient pam_localuser.so
account required pam_wheel.so

6.18. pam_loginuid - record user's login uid to the process attribute

pam_loginuid.so [ require_auditd ]

6.18.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_loginuid module sets the loginuid process attribute for the process
that was authenticated. This is necessary for applications to be correctly
audited. This PAM module should only be used for entry point applications like:
login, sshd, gdm, vsftpd, crond and atd. There are probably other entry point
applications besides these. You should not use it for applications like sudo or
su as that defeats the purpose by changing the loginuid to the account they
just switched to.

6.18.2. OPTIONS

require_auditd

    This option, when given, will cause this module to query the audit daemon
    status and deny logins if it is not running.

6.18.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the session module type is provided.

6.18.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The loginuid value is set and auditd is running if check requested.

PAM_IGNORE

    The /proc/self/loginuid file is not present on the system or the login
    process runs inside uid namespace and kernel does not support overwriting
    loginuid.

PAM_SESSION_ERR

    Any other error prevented setting loginuid or auditd is not running.

6.18.5. EXAMPLES

#%PAM-1.0
auth       required     pam_unix.so
auth       required     pam_nologin.so
account    required     pam_unix.so

6.19. pam_mail - inform about available mail

pam_mail.so [ close ] [ debug ] [ dir=maildir ] [ empty ] [ hash=count ] [
noenv ] [ nopen ] [ quiet ] [ standard ]

6.19.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_mail PAM module provides the "you have new mail" service to the user.
It can be plugged into any application that has credential or session hooks. It
gives a single message indicating the newness of any mail it finds in the
user's mail folder. This module also sets the PAM environment variable, MAIL,
to the user's mail directory.

If the mail spool file (be it /var/mail/$USER or a pathname given with the dir=
parameter) is a directory then pam_mail assumes it is in the Maildir format.

6.19.2. OPTIONS

close

    Indicate if the user has any mail also on logout.

debug

    Print debug information.

dir=maildir

    Look for the user's mail in an alternative location defined by maildir/
    <login>. The default location for mail is /var/mail/<login>. Note, if the
    supplied maildir is prefixed by a '~', the directory is interpreted as
    indicating a file in the user's home directory.

empty

    Also print message if user has no mail.

hash=count

    Mail directory hash depth. For example, a hashcount of 2 would make the
    mail file be /var/spool/mail/u/s/user.

noenv

    Do not set the MAIL environment variable.

nopen

    Don't print any mail information on login. This flag is useful to get the 
    MAIL environment variable set, but to not display any information about it.

quiet

    Only report when there is new mail.

standard

    Old style "You have..." format which doesn't show the mail spool being
    used. This also implies "empty".

6.19.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The session and auth (on establishment and deletion of credentials) module
types are provided.

6.19.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    Badly formed arguments.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Success.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

6.19.5. EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to indicate that the user has new
mail when they login to the system.

6.20. pam_mkhomedir - create users home directory

pam_mkhomedir.so [ silent ] [ umask=mode ] [ skel=skeldir ]

6.20.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_mkhomedir PAM module will create a users home directory if it does not
exist when the session begins. This allows users to be present in central
database (such as NIS, kerberos or LDAP) without using a distributed file
system or pre-creating a large number of directories. The skeleton directory
(usually /etc/skel/) is used to copy default files and also sets a umask for
the creation.

The new users home directory will not be removed after logout of the user.

6.20.2. OPTIONS

silent

    Don't print informative messages.

umask=mask

    The user file-creation mask is set to mask. The default value of mask is
    0022.

skel=/path/to/skel/directory

    Indicate an alternative skel directory to override the default /etc/skel.

6.20.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the session module type is provided.

6.20.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT

    Insufficient credentials to access authentication data.

PAM_PERM_DENIED

    Not enough permissions to create the new directory or read the skel
    directory.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known to the underlying authentication module.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Environment variables were set.

6.20.5. EXAMPLES

A sample /etc/pam.d/login file:

  auth       requisite   pam_securetty.so
  auth       sufficient  pam_ldap.so
  auth       required    pam_unix.so
  auth       required    pam_nologin.so
  account    sufficient  pam_ldap.so
  account    required    pam_unix.so
  password   required    pam_unix.so
  session    required    pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel/ umask=0022

6.21. pam_motd - display the motd file

pam_motd.so [ motd=/path/filename ]

6.21.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_motd is a PAM module that can be used to display arbitrary motd (message of
the day) files after a successful login. By default the /etc/motd file is
shown. The message size is limited to 64KB.

6.21.2. OPTIONS

motd=/path/filename

    The /path/filename file is displayed as message of the day.

6.21.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the session module type is provided.

6.21.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_IGNORE

    This is the only return value of this module.

6.21.5. EXAMPLES

The suggested usage for /etc/pam.d/login is:

6.22. pam_namespace - setup a private namespace

pam_namespace.so [ debug ] [ unmnt_remnt ] [ unmnt_only ] [ require_selinux ] [
gen_hash ] [ ignore_config_error ] [ ignore_instance_parent_mode ] [
unmount_on_close ] [ use_current_context ] [ use_default_context ] [
mount_private ]

6.22.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_namespace PAM module sets up a private namespace for a session with
polyinstantiated directories. A polyinstantiated directory provides a different
instance of itself based on user name, or when using SELinux, user name,
security context or both. If an executable script /etc/security/namespace.init
exists, it is used to initialize the instance directory after it is set up and
mounted on the polyinstantiated directory. The script receives the
polyinstantiated directory path, the instance directory path, flag whether the
instance directory was newly created (0 for no, 1 for yes), and the user name
as its arguments.

The pam_namespace module disassociates the session namespace from the parent
namespace. Any mounts/unmounts performed in the parent namespace, such as
mounting of devices, are not reflected in the session namespace. To propagate
selected mount/unmount events from the parent namespace into the disassociated
session namespace, an administrator may use the special shared-subtree feature.
For additional information on shared-subtree feature, please refer to the mount
(8) man page and the shared-subtree description at http://lwn.net/Articles/
159077 and http://lwn.net/Articles/159092.

6.22.2. DESCRIPTION

The pam_namespace.so module allows setup of private namespaces with
polyinstantiated directories. Directories can be polyinstantiated based on user
name or, in the case of SELinux, user name, sensitivity level or complete
security context. If an executable script /etc/security/namespace.init exists,
it is used to initialize the namespace every time an instance directory is set
up and mounted. The script receives the polyinstantiated directory path and the
instance directory path as its arguments.

The /etc/security/namespace.conf file specifies which directories are
polyinstantiated, how they are polyinstantiated, how instance directories would
be named, and any users for whom polyinstantiation would not be performed.

When someone logs in, the file namespace.conf is scanned. Comments are marked
by # characters. Each non comment line represents one polyinstantiated
directory. The fields are separated by spaces but can be quoted by " characters
also escape sequences \b, \n, and \t are recognized. The fields are as follows:

polydir instance_prefix method list_of_uids

The first field, polydir, is the absolute pathname of the directory to
polyinstantiate. The special string $HOME is replaced with the user's home
directory, and $USER with the username. This field cannot be blank.

The second field, instance_prefix is the string prefix used to build the
pathname for the instantiation of <polydir>. Depending on the polyinstantiation
method it is then appended with "instance differentiation string" to generate
the final instance directory path. This directory is created if it did not
exist already, and is then bind mounted on the <polydir> to provide an instance
of <polydir> based on the <method> column. The special string $HOME is replaced
with the user's home directory, and $USER with the username. This field cannot
be blank.

The third field, method, is the method used for polyinstantiation. It can take
these values; "user" for polyinstantiation based on user name, "level" for
polyinstantiation based on process MLS level and user name, "context" for
polyinstantiation based on process security context and user name, "tmpfs" for
mounting tmpfs filesystem as an instance dir, and "tmpdir" for creating
temporary directory as an instance dir which is removed when the user's session
is closed. Methods "context" and "level" are only available with SELinux. This
field cannot be blank.

The fourth field, list_of_uids, is a comma separated list of user names for
whom the polyinstantiation is not performed. If left blank, polyinstantiation
will be performed for all users. If the list is preceded with a single "~"
character, polyinstantiation is performed only for users in the list.

The method field can contain also following optional flags separated by :
characters.

create=mode,owner,group - create the polyinstantiated directory. The mode,
owner and group parameters are optional. The default for mode is determined by
umask, the default owner is the user whose session is opened, the default group
is the primary group of the user.

iscript=path - path to the instance directory init script. The base directory
for relative paths is /etc/security/namespace.d.

noinit - instance directory init script will not be executed.

shared - the instance directories for "context" and "level" methods will not
contain the user name and will be shared among all users.

mntopts=value - value of this flag is passed to the mount call when the tmpfs
mount is done. It allows for example the specification of the maximum size of
the tmpfs instance that is created by the mount call. See mount(8) for details.

The directory where polyinstantiated instances are to be created, must exist
and must have, by default, the mode of 0000. The requirement that the instance
parent be of mode 0000 can be overridden with the command line option 
ignore_instance_parent_mode

In case of context or level polyinstantiation the SELinux context which is used
for polyinstantiation is the context used for executing a new process as
obtained by getexeccon. This context must be set by the calling application or
pam_selinux.so module. If this context is not set the polyinstatiation will be
based just on user name.

The "instance differentiation string" is <user name> for "user" method and
<user name>_<raw directory context> for "context" and "level" methods. If the
whole string is too long the end of it is replaced with md5sum of itself. Also
when command line option gen_hash is used the whole string is replaced with
md5sum of itself.

6.22.3. OPTIONS

debug

    A lot of debug information is logged using syslog

unmnt_remnt

    For programs such as su and newrole, the login session has already setup a
    polyinstantiated namespace. For these programs, polyinstantiation is
    performed based on new user id or security context, however the command
    first needs to undo the polyinstantiation performed by login. This argument
    instructs the command to first undo previous polyinstantiation before
    proceeding with new polyinstantiation based on new id/context

unmnt_only

    For trusted programs that want to undo any existing bind mounts and process
    instance directories on their own, this argument allows them to unmount
    currently mounted instance directories

require_selinux

    If selinux is not enabled, return failure

gen_hash

    Instead of using the security context string for the instance name,
    generate and use its md5 hash.

ignore_config_error

    If a line in the configuration file corresponding to a polyinstantiated
    directory contains format error, skip that line process the next line.
    Without this option, pam will return an error to the calling program
    resulting in termination of the session.

ignore_instance_parent_mode

    Instance parent directories by default are expected to have the restrictive
    mode of 000. Using this option, an administrator can choose to ignore the
    mode of the instance parent. This option should be used with caution as it
    will reduce security and isolation goals of the polyinstantiation
    mechanism.

unmount_on_close

    Explicitly unmount the polyinstantiated directories instead of relying on
    automatic namespace destruction after the last process in a namespace
    exits. This option should be used only in case it is ensured by other means
    that there cannot be any processes running in the private namespace left
    after the session close. It is also useful only in case there are multiple
    pam session calls in sequence from the same process.

use_current_context

    Useful for services which do not change the SELinux context with setexeccon
    call. The module will use the current SELinux context of the calling
    process for the level and context polyinstantiation.

use_default_context

    Useful for services which do not use pam_selinux for changing the SELinux
    context with setexeccon call. The module will use the default SELinux
    context of the user for the level and context polyinstantiation.

mount_private

    This option can be used on systems where the / mount point or its submounts
    are made shared (for example with a mount --make-rshared / command). The
    module will mark the whole directory tree so any mount and unmount
    operations in the polyinstantiation namespace are private. Normally the
    pam_namespace will try to detect the shared / mount point and make the
    polyinstantiated directories private automatically. This option has to be
    used just when only a subtree is shared and / is not.

    Note that mounts and unmounts done in the private namespace will not affect
    the parent namespace if this option is used or when the shared / mount
    point is autodetected.

6.22.4. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the session module type is provided. The module must not be called from
multithreaded processes.

6.22.5. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    Namespace setup was successful.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    Unexpected system error occurred while setting up namespace.

PAM_SESSION_ERR

    Unexpected namespace configuration error occurred.

6.22.6. FILES

/etc/security/namespace.conf

    Main configuration file

/etc/security/namespace.d

    Directory for additional configuration files

/etc/security/namespace.init

    Init script for instance directories

6.22.7. EXAMPLES

These are some example lines which might be specified in /etc/security/
namespace.conf.


      # The following three lines will polyinstantiate /tmp,
      # /var/tmp and user's home directories. /tmp and /var/tmp
      # will be polyinstantiated based on the security level
      # as well as user name, whereas home directory will be
      # polyinstantiated based on the full security context and user name.
      # Polyinstantiation will not be performed for user root
      # and adm for directories /tmp and /var/tmp, whereas home
      # directories will be polyinstantiated for all users.
      #
      # Note that instance directories do not have to reside inside
      # the polyinstantiated directory. In the examples below,
      # instances of /tmp will be created in /tmp-inst directory,
      # where as instances of /var/tmp and users home directories
      # will reside within the directories that are being
      # polyinstantiated.
      #
      /tmp     /tmp-inst/               level      root,adm
      /var/tmp /var/tmp/tmp-inst/    level      root,adm
      $HOME    $HOME/$USER.inst/inst- context
    

For the <service>s you need polyinstantiation (login for example) put the
following line in /etc/pam.d/<service> as the last line for session group:

session required pam_namespace.so [arguments]

This module also depends on pam_selinux.so setting the context.

6.23. pam_nologin - prevent non-root users from login

pam_nologin.so [ file=/path/nologin ] [ successok ]

6.23.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_nologin is a PAM module that prevents users from logging into the system
when /var/run/nologin or /etc/nologin exists. The contents of the file are
displayed to the user. The pam_nologin module has no effect on the root user's
ability to log in.

6.23.2. OPTIONS

file=/path/nologin

    Use this file instead the default /var/run/nologin or /etc/nologin.

successok

    Return PAM_SUCCESS if no file exists, the default is PAM_IGNORE.

6.23.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and acct module types are provided.

6.23.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    The user is not root and /etc/nologin exists, so the user is not permitted
    to log in.

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_IGNORE

    This is the default return value.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Success: either the user is root or the nologin file does not exist.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known to the underlying authentication module.

6.23.5. EXAMPLES

The suggested usage for /etc/pam.d/login is:

auth  required  pam_nologin.so

pam_nologin was written by Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@redhat.com>.

6.24. pam_permit - the promiscuous module

pam_permit.so

6.24.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_permit is a PAM module that always permit access. It does nothing else.

In the case of authentication, the user's name will be set to nobody if the
application didn't set one. Many applications and PAM modules become confused
if this name is unknown.

This module is very dangerous. It should be used with extreme caution.

6.24.2. OPTIONS

This module does not recognise any options.

6.24.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth, account, password and session module types are provided.

6.24.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    This module always returns this value.

6.24.5. EXAMPLES

Add this line to your other login entries to disable account management, but
continue to permit users to log in.

account  required  pam_permit.so

6.25. pam_pwhistory - grant access using .pwhistory file

pam_pwhistory.so [ debug ] [ use_authtok ] [ enforce_for_root ] [ remember=N ]
[ retry=N ] [ authtok_type=STRING ]

6.25.1. DESCRIPTION

This module saves the last passwords for each user in order to force password
change history and keep the user from alternating between the same password too
frequently.

This module does not work together with kerberos. In general, it does not make
much sense to use this module in conjunction with NIS or LDAP, since the old
passwords are stored on the local machine and are not available on another
machine for password history checking.

6.25.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Turns on debugging via syslog(3).

use_authtok

    When password changing enforce the module to use the new password provided
    by a previously stacked password module (this is used in the example of the
    stacking of the pam_cracklib module documented below).

enforce_for_root

    If this option is set, the check is enforced for root, too.

remember=N

    The last N passwords for each user are saved in /etc/security/opasswd. The
    default is 10. Value of 0 makes the module to keep the existing contents of

6.26. pam_rhosts - grant access using .rhosts file

pam_rhosts.so

6.26.1. DESCRIPTION

This module performs the standard network authentication for services, as used
by traditional implementations of rlogin and rsh etc.

The authentication mechanism of this module is based on the contents of two
files; /etc/hosts.equiv (or and ~/.rhosts. Firstly, hosts listed in the former
file are treated as equivalent to the localhost. Secondly, entries in the
user's own copy of the latter file is used to map "remote-host remote-user"
pairs to that user's account on the current host. Access is granted to the user
if their host is present in /etc/hosts.equiv and their remote account is
identical to their local one, or if their remote account has an entry in their
personal configuration file.

The module authenticates a remote user (internally specified by the item
PAM_RUSER connecting from the remote host (internally specified by the item 
PAM_RHOST). Accordingly, for applications to be compatible this authentication
module they must set these items prior to calling pam_authenticate(). The
module is not capable of independently probing the network connection for such
information.

6.26.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

silent

    Don't print informative messages.

superuser=account

    Handle account as root.

6.26.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the auth module type is provided.

6.26.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    The remote host, remote user name or the local user name couldn't be
    determined or access was denied by .rhosts file.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User is not known to system.

6.26.5. EXAMPLES

To grant a remote user access by /etc/hosts.equiv or .rhosts for rsh add the
following lines to /etc/pam.d/rsh:

#%PAM-1.0
#
auth     required       pam_rhosts.so

6.27. pam_rootok - gain only root access

pam_rootok.so [ debug ]

6.27.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_rootok is a PAM module that authenticates the user if their UID is 0.
Applications that are created setuid-root generally retain the UID of the user
but run with the authority of an enhanced effective-UID. It is the real UID
that is checked.

6.27.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

6.27.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth, acct and password module types are provided.

6.27.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The UID is 0.

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    The UID is not 0.

6.27.5. EXAMPLES

In the case of the su(1) application the historical usage is to permit the
superuser to adopt the identity of a lesser user without the use of a password.
To obtain this behavior with PAM the following pair of lines are needed for the
corresponding entry in the /etc/pam.d/su configuration file:

# su authentication. Root is granted access by default.
auth  sufficient   pam_rootok.so
auth  required     pam_unix.so

6.28. pam_securetty - limit root login to special devices

pam_securetty.so [ debug ]

6.28.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_securetty is a PAM module that allows root logins only if the user is
logging in on a "secure" tty, as defined by the listing in /etc/securetty.
pam_securetty also checks to make sure that /etc/securetty is a plain file and
not world writable. It will also allow root logins on the tty specified with
console= switch on the kernel command line and on ttys from the /sys/class/tty/
console/active.

This module has no effect on non-root users and requires that the application
fills in the PAM_TTY item correctly.

For canonical usage, should be listed as a required authentication method
before any sufficient authentication methods.

6.28.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

noconsole

    Do not automatically allow root logins on the kernel console device, as
    specified on the kernel command line or by the sys file, if it is not also
    specified in the /etc/securetty file.

6.28.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the auth module type is provided.

6.28.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The user is allowed to continue authentication. Either the user is not
    root, or the root user is trying to log in on an acceptable device.

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    Authentication is rejected. Either root is attempting to log in via an
    unacceptable device, or the /etc/securetty file is world writable or not a
    normal file.

PAM_INCOMPLETE

    An application error occurred. pam_securetty was not able to get
    information it required from the application that called it.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    An error occurred while the module was determining the user's name or tty,
    or the module could not open /etc/securetty.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    The module could not find the user name in the /etc/passwd file to verify
    whether the user had a UID of 0. Therefore, the results of running this
    module are ignored.

6.28.5. EXAMPLES

auth  required  pam_securetty.so
auth  required  pam_unix.so

6.29. pam_selinux - set the default security context

pam_selinux.so [ open ] [ close ] [ restore ] [ nottys ] [ debug ] [ verbose ]
[ select_context ] [ env_params ] [ use_current_range ]

6.29.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_selinux is a PAM module that sets up the default SELinux security context
for the next executed process.

When a new session is started, the open_session part of the module computes and
sets up the execution security context used for the next execve(2) call, the
file security context for the controlling terminal, and the security context
used for creating a new kernel keyring.

When the session is ended, the close_session part of the module restores old
security contexts that were in effect before the change made by the
open_session part of the module.

Adding pam_selinux into the PAM stack might disrupt behavior of other PAM
modules which execute applications. To avoid that, pam_selinux.so open should
be placed after such modules in the PAM stack, and pam_selinux.so close should
be placed before them. When such a placement is not feasible, pam_selinux.so
restore could be used to temporary restore original security contexts.

6.29.2. OPTIONS

open

    Only execute the open_session part of the module.

close

    Only execute the close_session part of the module.

restore

    In open_session part of the module, temporarily restore the security
    contexts as they were before the previous call of the module. Another call
    of this module without the restore option will set up the new security
    contexts again.

nottys

    Do not setup security context of the controlling terminal.

debug

    Turn on debug messages via syslog(3).

verbose

    Attempt to inform the user when security context is set.

select_context

    Attempt to ask the user for a custom security context role. If MLS is on,
    ask also for sensitivity level.

env_params

    Attempt to obtain a custom security context role from PAM environment. If
    MLS is on, obtain also sensitivity level. This option and the
    select_context option are mutually exclusive. The respective PAM
    environment variables are SELINUX_ROLE_REQUESTED, SELINUX_LEVEL_REQUESTED,
    and SELINUX_USE_CURRENT_RANGE. The first two variables are self describing
    and the last one if set to 1 makes the PAM module behave as if the
    use_current_range was specified on the command line of the module.

use_current_range

    Use the sensitivity level of the current process for the user context
    instead of the default level. Also suppresses asking of the sensitivity
    level from the user or obtaining it from PAM environment.

6.29.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the session module type is provided.

6.29.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The security context was set successfully.

PAM_SESSION_ERR

    Unable to get or set a valid context.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    The user is not known to the system.

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory allocation error.

6.30.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_shells is a PAM module that only allows access to the system if the user's
shell is listed in /etc/shells.

It also checks if /etc/shells is a plain file and not world writable.

6.30.2. OPTIONS

This module does not recognise any options.

6.30.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and account module types are provided.

6.30.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    Access to the system was denied.

PAM_SUCCESS

    The user's login shell was listed as valid shell in /etc/shells.

6.31. pam_succeed_if - test account characteristics

pam_succeed_if.so [flag...] [condition...]

6.31.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_succeed_if.so is designed to succeed or fail authentication based on
characteristics of the account belonging to the user being authenticated or
values of other PAM items. One use is to select whether to load other modules
based on this test.

The module should be given one or more conditions as module arguments, and
authentication will succeed only if all of the conditions are met.

6.31.2. OPTIONS

The following flags are supported:

debug

    Turns on debugging messages sent to syslog.

use_uid

    Evaluate conditions using the account of the user whose UID the application
    is running under instead of the user being authenticated.

quiet

    Don't log failure or success to the system log.

quiet_fail

    Don't log failure to the system log.

quiet_success

    Don't log success to the system log.

audit

    Log unknown users to the system log.

Conditions are three words: a field, a test, and a value to test for.

Available fields are user, uid, gid, shell, home, ruser, rhost, tty and service
:

field < number

    Field has a value numerically less than number.

field <= number

    Field has a value numerically less than or equal to number.

field eq number

    Field has a value numerically equal to number.

field >= number

    Field has a value numerically greater than or equal to number.

field > number

    Field has a value numerically greater than number.

field ne number

    Field has a value numerically different from number.

field = string

    Field exactly matches the given string.

field != string

    Field does not match the given string.

field =~ glob

    Field matches the given glob.

field !~ glob

    Field is contained in the list of items separated by colons.

field notin item:item:...

    Field is not contained in the list of items separated by colons.

user ingroup group

    User is in given group.

user notingroup group

    User is not in given group.

user innetgr netgroup

    (user,host) is in given netgroup.

user notinnetgr group

    (user,host) is not in given netgroup.

6.31.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

All module types (account, auth, password and session) are provided.

6.31.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The condition was true.

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    The condition was false.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    A service error occurred or the arguments can't be parsed correctly.

6.31.5. EXAMPLES

To emulate the behaviour of pam_wheel, except there is no fallback to group 0:

auth required pam_succeed_if.so quiet user ingroup wheel


Given that the type matches, only loads the othermodule rule if the UID is over
500. Adjust the number after default to skip several rules.

6.32. pam_tally - login counter (tallying) module

pam_tally.so [ file=/path/to/counter ] [ onerr=[fail|succeed] ] [ magic_root ]
[ even_deny_root_account ] [ deny=n ] [ lock_time=n ] [ unlock_time=n ] [
per_user ] [ no_lock_time ] [ no_reset ] [ audit ] [ silent ] [ no_log_info ]

pam_tally [ --file /path/to/counter ] [ --user username ] [ --reset[=n] ] [
--quiet ]

6.32.1. DESCRIPTION

This module maintains a count of attempted accesses, can reset count on
success, can deny access if too many attempts fail.

pam_tally has several limitations, which are solved with pam_tally2. For this
reason pam_tally is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

pam_tally comes in two parts: pam_tally.so and pam_tally. The former is the PAM
module and the latter, a stand-alone program. pam_tally is an (optional)
application which can be used to interrogate and manipulate the counter file.
It can display user counts, set individual counts, or clear all counts. Setting
artificially high counts may be useful for blocking users without changing
their passwords. For example, one might find it useful to clear all counts
every midnight from a cron job. The faillog(8) command can be used instead of
pam_tally to to maintain the counter file.

Normally, failed attempts to access root will not cause the root account to
become blocked, to prevent denial-of-service: if your users aren't given shell
accounts and root may only login via su or at the machine console (not telnet/
rsh, etc), this is safe.

6.32.2. OPTIONS

GLOBAL OPTIONS

    This can be used for auth and account module types.

    onerr=[fail|succeed]

        If something weird happens (like unable to open the file), return with 
        PAM_SUCCESS if onerr=succeed is given, else with the corresponding PAM
        error code.

    file=/path/to/counter

        File where to keep counts. Default is /var/log/faillog.

    audit

        Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found.

    silent

        Don't print informative messages.

    no_log_info

        Don't log informative messages via syslog(3).

AUTH OPTIONS

    Authentication phase first checks if user should be denied access and if
    not it increments attempted login counter. Then on call to pam_setcred(3)
    it resets the attempts counter.

    deny=n

        Deny access if tally for this user exceeds n.

    lock_time=n

        Always deny for n seconds after failed attempt.

    unlock_time=n

        Allow access after n seconds after failed attempt. If this option is
        used the user will be locked out for the specified amount of time after
        he exceeded his maximum allowed attempts. Otherwise the account is
        locked until the lock is removed by a manual intervention of the system
        administrator.

    magic_root

        If the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 the counter is not
        incremented. The sysadmin should use this for user launched services,
        like su, otherwise this argument should be omitted.

    no_lock_time

        Do not use the .fail_locktime field in /var/log/faillog for this user.

    no_reset

        Don't reset count on successful entry, only decrement.

    even_deny_root_account

        Root account can become unavailable.

    per_user

        If /var/log/faillog contains a non-zero .fail_max/.fail_locktime field
        for this user then use it instead of deny=n/ lock_time=n parameter.

    no_lock_time

        Don't use .fail_locktime filed in /var/log/faillog for this user.

ACCOUNT OPTIONS

    Account phase resets attempts counter if the user is not magic root. This
    phase can be used optionally for services which don't call pam_setcred(3)
    correctly or if the reset should be done regardless of the failure of the
    account phase of other modules.

    magic_root

        If the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 the counter is not
        incremented. The sysadmin should use this for user launched services,
        like su, otherwise this argument should be omitted.

    no_reset

        Don't reset count on successful entry, only decrement.

6.32.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and account module types are provided.

6.32.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    A invalid option was given, the module was not able to retrieve the user
    name, no valid counter file was found, or too many failed logins.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Everything was successful.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

6.32.5. EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to lock the account after too many
failed logins. The number of allowed fails is specified by /var/log/faillog and
needs to be set with pam_tally or faillog(8) before.

auth     required       pam_securetty.so

        PAM_SUCCESS if onerr=succeed is given, else with the corresponding PAM
        error code.

    file=/path/to/counter

        File where to keep counts. Default is /var/log/tallylog.

    audit

        Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found.

    silent

        Don't print informative messages.

    no_log_info

        Don't log informative messages via syslog(3).

AUTH OPTIONS

    Authentication phase first increments attempted login counter and checks if
    user should be denied access. If the user is authenticated and the login
    process continues on call to pam_setcred(3) it resets the attempts counter.

    deny=n

        Deny access if tally for this user exceeds n.

    lock_time=n

        Always deny for n seconds after failed attempt.

    unlock_time=n

        Allow access after n seconds after failed attempt. If this option is
        used the user will be locked out for the specified amount of time after
        he exceeded his maximum allowed attempts. Otherwise the account is
        locked until the lock is removed by a manual intervention of the system
        administrator.

    magic_root

        If the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 the counter is not
        incremented. The sysadmin should use this for user launched services,
        like su, otherwise this argument should be omitted.

    even_deny_root

        Root account can become unavailable.

    root_unlock_time=n

        This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access after n seconds
        to root account after failed attempt. If this option is used the root
        user will be locked out for the specified amount of time after he
        exceeded his maximum allowed attempts.

    serialize

        Serialize access to the tally file using locks. This option might be
        used only for non-multithreaded services because it depends on the
        fcntl locking of the tally file. Also it is a good idea to use this
        option only in such configurations where the time between auth phase
        and account or setcred phase is not dependent on the authenticating
        client. Otherwise the authenticating client will be able to prevent
        simultaneous authentications by the same user by simply artificially
        prolonging the time the file record lock is held.

ACCOUNT OPTIONS

    Account phase resets attempts counter if the user is not magic root. This
    phase can be used optionally for services which don't call pam_setcred(3)
    correctly or if the reset should be done regardless of the failure of the
    account phase of other modules.

    magic_root

        If the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 the counter is not
        changed. The sysadmin should use this for user launched services, like 
        su, otherwise this argument should be omitted.

6.33.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and account module types are provided.

6.33.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    A invalid option was given, the module was not able to retrieve the user
    name, no valid counter file was found, or too many failed logins.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Everything was successful.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

6.33.5. NOTES

pam_tally2 is not compatible with the old pam_tally faillog file format. This
is caused by requirement of compatibility of the tallylog file format between
32bit and 64bit architectures on multiarch systems.

There is no setuid wrapper for access to the data file such as when the 
pam_tally2.so module is called from xscreensaver. As this would make it
impossible to share PAM configuration with such services the following
workaround is used: If the data file cannot be opened because of insufficient
permissions (EACCES) the module returns PAM_IGNORE.

6.33.6. EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to lock the account after 4 failed
logins. Root account will be locked as well. The accounts will be automatically
unlocked after 20 minutes. The module does not have to be called in the account
phase because the login calls pam_setcred(3) correctly.

6.34. pam_time - time controled access

pam_time.so [ debug ] [ noaudit ]

6.34.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it
restricts access to a system and or specific applications at various times of
the day and on specific days or over various terminal lines. This module can be
configured to deny access to (individual) users based on their name, the time
of day, the day of week, the service they are applying for and their terminal
from which they are making their request.

By default rules for time/port access are taken from config file /etc/security/
time.conf.

If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it
denies access.

6.34.2. DESCRIPTION

The pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it
restricts access to a system and or specific applications at various times of
the day and on specific days or over various terminal lines. This module can be
configured to deny access to (individual) users based on their name, the time
of day, the day of week, the service they are applying for and their terminal
from which they are making their request.

For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly formatted /etc/
security/time.conf file present. White spaces are ignored and lines maybe
extended with '\' (escaped newlines). Text following a '#' is ignored to the
end of the line.

The syntax of the lines is as follows:

services;ttys;users;times

In words, each rule occupies a line, terminated with a newline or the beginning
of a comment; a '#'. It contains four fields separated with semicolons, ';'.

The first field, the services field, is a logic list of PAM service names that
the rule applies to.

The second field, the tty field, is a logic list of terminal names that this
rule applies to.

The third field, the users field, is a logic list of users or a netgroup of
users to whom this rule applies.

For these items the simple wildcard '*' may be used only once. With netgroups
no wildcards or logic operators are allowed.

The times field is used to indicate the times at which this rule applies. The
format here is a logic list of day/time-range entries. The days are specified
by a sequence of two character entries, MoTuSa for example is Monday Tuesday
and Saturday. Note that repeated days are unset MoMo = no day, and MoWk = all
weekdays bar Monday. The two character combinations accepted are Mo Tu We Th Fr
Sa Su Wk Wd Al, the last two being week-end days and all 7 days of the week
respectively. As a final example, AlFr means all days except Friday.

Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a '!' to indicate "anything but". The
time-range part is two 24-hour times HHMM, separated by a hyphen, indicating
the start and finish time (if the finish time is smaller than the start time it
is deemed to apply on the following day).

For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be satisfied by the
applying process.

Note, currently there is no daemon enforcing the end of a session. This needs
to be remedied.

Poorly formatted rules are logged as errors using syslog(3).

6.35. pam_timestamp - authenticate using cached successful authentication
attempts

pam_timestamp.so [ timestampdir=directory ] [ timestamp_timeout=number ] [
verbose ] [ debug ]

6.35.1. DESCRIPTION

In a nutshell, pam_timestamp caches successful authentication attempts, and
allows you to use a recent successful attempt as the basis for authentication.
This is similar mechanism which is used in sudo.

When an application opens a session using pam_timestamp, a timestamp file is
created in the timestampdir directory for the user. When an application
attempts to authenticate the user, a pam_timestamp will treat a sufficiently
recent timestamp file as grounds for succeeding.

6.35.2. OPTIONS

timestampdir=directory

    Specify an alternate directory where pam_timestamp creates timestamp files.

timestamp_timeout=number

    How long should pam_timestamp treat timestamp as valid after their last
    modification date (in seconds). Default is 300 seconds.

verbose

    Attempt to inform the user when access is granted.

debug

    Turns on debugging messages sent to syslog(3).

6.35.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and session module types are provided.

6.35.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    The module was not able to retrieve the user name or no valid timestamp
    file was found.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Everything was successful.

PAM_SESSION_ERR

    Timestamp file could not be created or updated.

6.35.5. NOTES

Users can get confused when they are not always asked for passwords when
running a given program. Some users reflexively begin typing information before
noticing that it is not being asked for.

6.35.6. EXAMPLES

auth sufficient pam_timestamp.so verbose
auth required   pam_unix.so

session required pam_unix.so
session optional pam_timestamp.so


6.35.7. FILES

/var/run/pam_timestamp/...

6.36. pam_umask - set the file mode creation mask

pam_umask.so [ debug ] [ silent ] [ usergroups ] [ umask=mask ]

6.36.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_umask is a PAM module to set the file mode creation mask of the current
environment. The umask affects the default permissions assigned to newly
created files.

The PAM module tries to get the umask value from the following places in the
following order:

  * umask= argument

  * umask= entry in the user's GECOS field

  * UMASK= entry from /etc/default/login

  * UMASK entry from /etc/login.defs

The GECOS field is split on comma ',' characters. The module also in addition
to the umask= entry recognizes pri= entry, which sets the nice priority value
for the session, and ulimit= entry, which sets the maximum size of files the
processes in the session can create.

6.36.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

silent

    Don't print informative messages.

usergroups

    If the user is not root and the username is the same as primary group name,
    the umask group bits are set to be the same as owner bits (examples: 022 ->
    002, 077 -> 007).

umask=mask

    Sets the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask) to mask & 0777.
    The value is interpreted as Octal.

6.36.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the session type is provided.

6.36.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_SUCCESS

    The new umask was set successfully.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    No username was given.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

6.36.5. EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to set the user specific umask at
login:

        session optional pam_umask.so umask=0022

6.37. pam_unix - traditional password authentication

pam_unix.so [ ... ]

6.37.1. DESCRIPTION

This is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard calls from
the system's libraries to retrieve and set account information as well as
authentication. Usually this is obtained from the /etc/passwd and the /etc/
shadow file as well if shadow is enabled.

The account component performs the task of establishing the status of the
user's account and password based on the following shadow elements: expire,
last_change, max_change, min_change, warn_change. In the case of the latter, it
may offer advice to the user on changing their password or, through the 
PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD return, delay giving service to the user until they have
established a new password. The entries listed above are documented in the 
shadow(5) manual page. Should the user's record not contain one or more of
these entries, the corresponding shadow check is not performed.

The authentication component performs the task of checking the users
credentials (password). The default action of this module is to not permit the
user access to a service if their official password is blank.

A helper binary, unix_chkpwd(8), is provided to check the user's password when
it is stored in a read protected database. This binary is very simple and will
only check the password of the user invoking it. It is called transparently on
behalf of the user by the authenticating component of this module. In this way
it is possible for applications like xlock(1) to work without being
setuid-root. The module, by default, will temporarily turn off SIGCHLD handling
for the duration of execution of the helper binary. This is generally the right
thing to do, as many applications are not prepared to handle this signal from a
child they didn't know was fork()d. The noreap module argument can be used to
suppress this temporary shielding and may be needed for use with certain
applications.

The maximum length of a password supported by the pam_unix module via the
helper binary is PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE - currently 512 bytes. The rest of the
password provided by the conversation function to the module will be ignored.

The password component of this module performs the task of updating the user's
password. The default encryption hash is taken from the ENCRYPT_METHOD variable
from /etc/login.defs

The session component of this module logs when a user logins or leave the
system.

Remaining arguments, supported by others functions of this module, are silently
ignored. Other arguments are logged as errors through syslog(3).

6.37.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Turns on debugging via syslog(3).

audit

    A little more extreme than debug.

quiet

    Turns off informational messages namely messages about session open and
    close via syslog(3).

nullok

    The default action of this module is to not permit the user access to a
    service if their official password is blank. The nullok argument overrides
    this default.

try_first_pass

    Before prompting the user for their password, the module first tries the
    previous stacked module's password in case that satisfies this module as
    well.

use_first_pass

    The argument use_first_pass forces the module to use a previous stacked
    modules password and will never prompt the user - if no password is
    available or the password is not appropriate, the user will be denied
    access.

nodelay

    This argument can be used to discourage the authentication component from
    requesting a delay should the authentication as a whole fail. The default
    action is for the module to request a delay-on-failure of the order of two
    second.

use_authtok

    When password changing enforce the module to set the new password to the
    one provided by a previously stacked password module (this is used in the
    example of the stacking of the pam_cracklib module documented below).

not_set_pass

    This argument is used to inform the module that it is not to pay attention
    to/make available the old or new passwords from/to other (stacked) password
    modules.

nis

    NIS RPC is used for setting new passwords.

remember=n

    The last n passwords for each user are saved in /etc/security/opasswd in
    order to force password change history and keep the user from alternating
    between the same password too frequently. Instead of this option the 
    pam_pwhistory module should be used.

shadow

    Try to maintain a shadow based system.

md5

    When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the MD5 algorithm.

bigcrypt

    When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the DEC C2
    algorithm.

sha256

    When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the SHA256
    algorithm. If the SHA256 algorithm is not known to the crypt(3) function,
    fall back to MD5.

sha512

    When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the SHA512
    algorithm. If the SHA512 algorithm is not known to the crypt(3) function,
    fall back to MD5.

blowfish

    When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the blowfish
    algorithm. If the blowfish algorithm is not known to the crypt(3) function,
    fall back to MD5.

rounds=n

    Set the optional number of rounds of the SHA256, SHA512 and blowfish
    password hashing algorithms to n.

broken_shadow

    Ignore errors reading shadow information for users in the account
    management module.

minlen=n

    Set a minimum password length of n characters. The max. for DES crypt based
    passwords are 8 characters.

Invalid arguments are logged with syslog(3).

6.37.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

All module types (account, auth, password and session) are provided.

6.37.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_IGNORE

    Ignore this module.

6.37.5. EXAMPLES

An example usage for /etc/pam.d/login would be:

6.38. pam_userdb - authenticate against a db database

pam_userdb.so db=/path/database [ debug ] [ crypt=[crypt|none] ] [ icase ] [
dump ] [ try_first_pass ] [ use_first_pass ] [ unknown_ok ] [ key_only ]

6.38.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_userdb module is used to verify a username/password pair against values
stored in a Berkeley DB database. The database is indexed by the username, and
the data fields corresponding to the username keys are the passwords.

6.38.2. OPTIONS

crypt=[crypt|none]

    Indicates whether encrypted or plaintext passwords are stored in the
    database. If it is crypt, passwords should be stored in the database in 
    crypt(3) form. If none is selected, passwords should be stored in the
    database as plaintext.

db=/path/database

    Use the /path/database database for performing lookup. There is no default;
    the module will return PAM_IGNORE if no database is provided. Note that the
    path to the database file should be specified without the .db suffix.

debug

    Print debug information.

dump

    Dump all the entries in the database to the log. Don't do this by default!

icase

    Make the password verification to be case insensitive (ie when working with
    registration numbers and such). Only works with plaintext password storage.

try_first_pass

    Use the authentication token previously obtained by another module that did
    the conversation with the application. If this token can not be obtained
    then the module will try to converse. This option can be used for stacking
    different modules that need to deal with the authentication tokens.

use_first_pass

    Use the authentication token previously obtained by another module that did
    the conversation with the application. If this token can not be obtained
    then the module will fail. This option can be used for stacking different
    modules that need to deal with the authentication tokens.

unknown_ok

    Do not return error when checking for a user that is not in the database.
    This can be used to stack more than one pam_userdb module that will check a
    username/password pair in more than a database.

key_only

    The username and password are concatenated together in the database hash as
    'username-password' with a random value. if the concatenation of the
    username and password with a dash in the middle returns any result, the
    user is valid. this is useful in cases where the username may not be unique
    but the username and password pair are.

6.38.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and account module types are provided.

6.38.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    Authentication failure.

PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR

    Authentication information cannot be recovered.

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_CONV_ERR

    Conversation failure.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    Error in service module.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Success.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known to the underlying authentication module.

6.39. pam_warn - logs all PAM items

pam_warn.so

6.39.1. DESCRIPTION

pam_warn is a PAM module that logs the service, terminal, user, remote user and
remote host to syslog(3). The items are not probed for, but instead obtained
from the standard PAM items. The module always returns PAM_IGNORE, indicating
that it does not want to affect the authentication process.

6.39.2. OPTIONS

This module does not recognise any options.

6.39.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth, account, password and session module types are provided.

6.39.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_IGNORE

    This module always returns PAM_IGNORE.

6.39.5. EXAMPLES

6.40. pam_wheel - only permit root access to members of group wheel

pam_wheel.so [ debug ] [ deny ] [ group=name ] [ root_only ] [ trust ] [
use_uid ]

6.40.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_wheel PAM module is used to enforce the so-called wheel group. By
default it permits root access to the system if the applicant user is a member
of the wheel group. If no group with this name exist, the module is using the
group with the group-ID 0.

6.40.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

deny

    Reverse the sense of the auth operation: if the user is trying to get UID 0
    access and is a member of the wheel group (or the group of the group
    option), deny access. Conversely, if the user is not in the group, return
    PAM_IGNORE (unless trust was also specified, in which case we return
    PAM_SUCCESS).

group=name

    Instead of checking the wheel or GID 0 groups, use the name group to
    perform the authentication.

root_only

    The check for wheel membership is done only.

trust

    The pam_wheel module will return PAM_SUCCESS instead of PAM_IGNORE if the
    user is a member of the wheel group (thus with a little play stacking the
    modules the wheel members may be able to su to root without being prompted
    for a passwd).

use_uid

    The check for wheel membership will be done against the current uid instead
    of the original one (useful when jumping with su from one account to
    another for example).

6.40.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

The auth and account module types are provided.

6.40.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_AUTH_ERR

    Authentication failure.

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_IGNORE

    The return value should be ignored by PAM dispatch.

PAM_PERM_DENY

    Permission denied.

PAM_SERVICE_ERR

    Cannot determine the user name.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Success.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.

6.40.5. EXAMPLES

The root account gains access by default (rootok), only wheel members can
become root (wheel) but Unix authenticate non-root applicants.

su      auth     sufficient     pam_rootok.so
su      auth     required       pam_wheel.so

6.41. pam_xauth - forward xauth keys between users

pam_xauth.so [ debug ] [ xauthpath=/path/to/xauth ] [ systemuser=UID ] [
targetuser=UID ]

6.41.1. DESCRIPTION

The pam_xauth PAM module is designed to forward xauth keys (sometimes referred
to as "cookies") between users.

Without pam_xauth, when xauth is enabled and a user uses the su(1) command to
assume another user's privileges, that user is no longer able to access the
original user's X display because the new user does not have the key needed to
access the display. pam_xauth solves the problem by forwarding the key from the
user running su (the source user) to the user whose identity the source user is
assuming (the target user) when the session is created, and destroying the key
when the session is torn down.

This means, for example, that when you run su(1) from an xterm session, you
will be able to run X programs without explicitly dealing with the xauth(1)
xauth command or ~/.Xauthority files.

pam_xauth will only forward keys if xauth can list a key connected to the
$DISPLAY environment variable.

Primitive access control is provided by ~/.xauth/export in the invoking user's
home directory and ~/.xauth/import in the target user's home directory.

If a user has a ~/.xauth/import file, the user will only receive cookies from
users listed in the file. If there is no ~/.xauth/import file, the user will
accept cookies from any other user.

If a user has a .xauth/export file, the user will only forward cookies to users
listed in the file. If there is no ~/.xauth/export file, and the invoking user
is not root, the user will forward cookies to any other user. If there is no ~
/.xauth/export file, and the invoking user is root, the user will not forward
cookies to other users.

Both the import and export files support wildcards (such as *). Both the import
and export files can be empty, signifying that no users are allowed.

6.41.2. OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

xauthpath=/path/to/xauth

    Specify the path the xauth program (it is expected in /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth,
    /usr/bin/xauth, or /usr/bin/X11/xauth by default).

systemuser=UID

    Specify the highest UID which will be assumed to belong to a "system" user.
    pam_xauth will refuse to forward credentials to users with UID less than or
    equal to this number, except for root and the "targetuser", if specified.

targetuser=UID

    Specify a single target UID which is exempt from the systemuser check.

6.41.3. MODULE TYPES PROVIDED

Only the session type is provided.

6.41.4. RETURN VALUES

PAM_BUF_ERR

    Memory buffer error.

PAM_PERM_DENIED

    Permission denied by import/export file.

PAM_SESSION_ERR

    Cannot determine user name, UID or access users home directory.

PAM_SUCCESS

    Success.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

    User not known.
