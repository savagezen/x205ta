_Description:
 To encrypt your home directory or "Private" folder, a strong
 passphrase has been automatically generated. Usually your directory is unlocked
 with your user password, but if you ever need to manually recover this
 directory, you will need this passphrase. Please print or write it down and
 store it in a safe location.
 If you click "Run this action now", enter your login password at the
 "Passphrase" prompt and you can display your randomly generated passphrase.
 Otherwise, you will need to run "ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase" from the command
 line to retrieve and record your generated passphrase.
